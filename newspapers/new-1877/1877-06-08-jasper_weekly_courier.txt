The Chinese students have made wonderful progress since the
establishment of the educational headquarters at Hartford. They show
good abilities to contend with American students. One Chinese scholar
has taken the second prize for declamation in the Hartford High
School, and another the first in the South Hadley Falls High School;
and now Lee Kwai Pau takes the first prize for penmanship in the West
Middle Public School at Hartford.
