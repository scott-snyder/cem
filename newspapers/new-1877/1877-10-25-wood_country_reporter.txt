Mrs. Sien Chin wife of the official Chinese interpreter and
translator for the teachers and students in Hartford, Connecticut,
died a few days since, at the age of twenty-two. She was of a good and
opulent Canton family, and at seventeen was married to Kweng Ki Chin,
who, having studied English at Hong Kong, was then preparing to go to
Shanghai, where he instructed the Chinese boys now in school in
America in the English language, preparatory to their course of
studies here. Twenty two months ago he came over with the last
installment of pupils, bringing his young wife with him. Shortly after
they arrived their first child was bornâ€” a boy who bids fair to make a
healthy, robust American, The deceased had many friends among her
neighbors, who appreciated the wifely love and motherly tenderness she
constantly exhibited.  Her dying thought was of solicitude for the
welfare of her child, her last whispering words being, "Who will love
my little boy now?" She is said to have been one of the most beautiful
women of her race, and was thoroughly worshiped in the home she made
happy.
