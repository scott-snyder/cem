In China it is highly improper for a man and a woman to be seen
walking together in public. A man may not even ask his friend of the
health of his wife or any of his female children. It is a tabooed
subject. Some years ago a company of students were sent to this
country by the Chinese government, and their headquarters were in
Hartford, Conn. One day one of the young students had been to church
and Sunday school, and walking home with a young lady, American
fashion, he met the Chinese director of this educational mission, as
it was called. He took off his hat politely before his
superior–another offense in China–and the old disciple of Confucius
looked at him in horror. This was reported in Peking, and
characterized as an entire loss of the sense of decency. With other
causes it led to the recall of the whole body of students. This will
give some little idea of the variety of problems that our missionaries
have to deal with in trying to lead this people into the light.
