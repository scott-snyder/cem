The thirty Chinese students who arrived yesterday are very young. They
are fine intelligent ladies and gentlemen and of much fairer
complexion than any of their countrymen who have heretofore visited
the United States.  Three tutors of Mandarin rank accompany them. The
Chinese government has appropriated one million dollars for their
education.  The design of the Chinese government is to send thirty
students to this country annually.
