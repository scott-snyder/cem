A telegram from San Francisco states that the thirty young Chinese
students who arrived on Friday last are fine intelligent ladies and
gentlemen, and of much fairer complexions than any of their countrymen
who have heretofore visited the United States. Three tutors of the
Mandarin rank accompany them. The Chinese Government appropriated
$1,000,000 for their education.  The design of the Chinese Government
is to send thirty students to this country annually.
