The thirty Chinese students who arrived yesterday are very young. They
are fine intelligent ladies and gentlemen and of much fairer
complexion than any of their countrymen who have heretofore visited
the United States. Three tutors are accompanying them. The Chinese
Government appropriated one million dollars for their education. The
design of the Chinese Government is to send thirty students to this
country annually.
