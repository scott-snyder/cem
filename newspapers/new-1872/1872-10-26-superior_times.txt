The Chinese Students.

Yesterday afternoon eighteen of the Chinese boys who have been sent to
this country to be educated, arrived in New Haven, under the care of
Tsang Laison,a graduate of Hamilton College, and second mandarin in
the empire.  They were met by Secretary B. G. Northrop and taken to
the Tremont House.  The boys are bright and intelligent and from nine
to fifteen years of age.  They were dressed in oriental costumes and
attracted a great deal of attention.  Mr. Laison and Secretary
Northrop immediately delivered the boys to those persons who are to
have the care of them. Four boys will remain in New Haven, two of them
at Fair Haven, and two at Westville. Four are in Hartford, and
twenty-two in all in Connecticut. They will stay some fifteen
years,and complete a collegiate course.  Mr. Laison remains until
summer, and will have the general oversight, and next autumn will
return with about thirty more.â€” New Haven Palladium Sept. 26.
