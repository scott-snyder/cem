Arrival of Chinese. San Francisco, Sept. 14.--The thirty Chinese
students who arrived yesterday are very young. There are nine
intelligent ladies and gentlemen, and of much fairer complexion than
any of their countrymen who have heretofore visit- ed the United
States. Tutors of the Mandarin rank accompany them. The Chinese
government appropriated one million dollars for their education. The
design of the Chinese government is to send thirty students to this
country annually.

The Chinese ladies and the boy students are receiving much
attention. As the last students, while in America, became contaminated
by Christianity, all the forms of religion of Confucius will be
rigidly enforced, and the form books of the five Kings, and the sacred
edit of Emperor Kanghi, will be portions of their regular lessons.
