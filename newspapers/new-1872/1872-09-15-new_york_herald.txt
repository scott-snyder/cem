The thirty Chinese students who arrived yesterday are very young. They
are fine, intelligent ladles and gentlemen and of much fairer
complexion than any of their countrymen who have heretofore visited
the United States. Three tutors of the mandarin rank accompany
them. The Chinese government appropriated $1,000,000 for their
education.  The design of the Chinese government is to send thirty
students to this country annually.
