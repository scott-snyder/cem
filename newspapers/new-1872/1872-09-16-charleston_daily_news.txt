-The thirty Chinese students who arrived at San Francisco on Saturday
are very young.  They are fine, intelligent ladies and gentlemen, and
of much fairer complexion than any of their countrymen who have
heretofore visited the United States. Three tutors of Mandarin rank
accompany them. The Chinese Government appropriated $1,000,000 for
their education. The design of the Chinese Government is to send
thirty students to this country annually.
