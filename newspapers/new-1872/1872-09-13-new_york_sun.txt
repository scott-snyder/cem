Thirty Chinese youths have recently arrived in San Francisco, sent by
the Chinese Government to pursue their education in the United
States. They are accompanied by two guardians and two tutors, and if
the experiment meets with a generous reception it is intended to
increase their number to one hundred and fifty.  These students are
under tho special patronage of the Viceroy of Pekin, although the
Imperial Government pays the expense of their education. One of the
guardians of these students is Yung Wing, a Chinese gentleman of
intelligence and refinement who received his education at one of our
American colleges.
