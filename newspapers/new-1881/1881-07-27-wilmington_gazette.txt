Why the Chinese Students Must Go

Cheyenne, July 26.--The Leader to-morrow will contain a report of an
interview with Tsu Soon Kee, an attache of the Chinese Embassy at
Washington.  He says that the Chinese students withdrawn from America
will be sent to England, France, and Germany.  The number one hundred.
The Chinese Government will hereafter educate students in Europe and
also in China, where military and naval schools are being established.
The inference drawn by the interviewer is that the Chinese Government
fears the progressiveness of American institutions.
