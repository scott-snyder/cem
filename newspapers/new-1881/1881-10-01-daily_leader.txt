The Last Party of the Chinese Students.

Attached to yesterday’s overland train from the east was the Pullman
car, “Humboldt,” occupied by a party of 23 Chinese students, with
their native professor, Shin. The departure of this party from San
Francisco will complete the exodus of the Celestial empire’s
government students in this country, this being the third and last
party. For gentlemanly behavior, quiet, unassuming manners and general
intelligence, it is doubtful if any country can show their
superiors. It has been a general verdict with those who have been
brought in contact with them in various capacities, that they are an
excellent class of young men, and the necessity for their departure is
a cause for regret.  That they entertain like kindly feelings toward
their instructors and others in the east, is shown by the numerous
letters and cards which they send from each station along the route,
recording the progress of their homeward journey.

That they are not overjoyed by their unceremonious recall, is apparent
from their conversation. Speaking with one of the party, T. S. Tsiang,
in this regard he said, "it was hard to break in the midst of their
studies when they were just getting into the best part of their work,”
exhibiting the true student’s love for his task. He thought, however,
that some way would be provided for them to complete their courses,
and, of the three countries to which they would probably be sent,
England, France, or Germany, that the former would be given the
preference, on account of their familiarity with its language. Some of
the students wore mourning badges, an expression of their feeling
toward the dead president.
