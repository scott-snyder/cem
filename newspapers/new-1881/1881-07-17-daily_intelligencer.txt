A Narrow Policy.

Hartford, July 15â€”There is a probability that the promising
educational scheme which the Chinese Government has been trying in
this country for the past ten years will suddenly come to an
end. There is reason to believe that Chin Lan Phin and Young Wing, the
ambassadors to this country, have been superseded by a new minister,
who is instructed to put a stop to the educational project and have
those connected with it, students, instructors and attendants, sent
back to China. The headquarters of the commission has always been in
this city, where it owns a fine building for a residence. There are at
least 1000 young men in the country, about 500 being in various
colleges, while the others are in preparatory schools. They are picked
boys of good families, have exhibited great aptitude for study and
have made themselves favorites everywhere.  The abandonment of the
enterprise, if it is decided upon, will occasion much regret. It was
originated by Young Wing, himself a Yale graduate and one of the most
progressive Chinese statesmen of the age. He has resided in this
country during the past ten years and with the sanction of his
government adopted American dress and married an American wife, an
intelligent lady of Avon, in this State. For several years be has been
associated with Chin Lan Pin in charge of the embassy to this
country. It is reported that both these gentlemen are preparing to
return to China and that the first boys to be returned will be those
of the recently formed school of telegraphy.
