Too Progressive for the Chinese.

Cheyenne, July 26.- Th Leader to-morrow will contain an interview with
Tsu Soon Kee, attache of the Chinese embassy at Washington. He says
the Chinese students withdrawn from America will be sent to England,
France and Germany. They number 100. The Chinese government will
hereafter educate students in Europe and China where military and
naval schools are being established. The inference drawn by the
interviewer is the Chinese government fears the progressiveness of
American institutions.
