China's Telegraphy.

New York, June 18.---The Herald's special says the Chinese Government
recently sent instructions through their embassy, at Washington, to
the Chinese Educational Commissioner, in this city, to establish a
department of telegraphy and operations will be commenced next
week. At present there is no telegraphic communications in the Chinese
Empire except between a few of the larger places on the coast. It is
understood that the communication is solely in English or other
tongues than Chinese and that no system has yet been devised by which
the Chinese can communicate by wire in their own language. The
project, as reported here, contemplates the establishment of a
governmental system to extend to all of the empire with operators who
will be thoroughly instructed alike in theory, practical operation and
electric telegraphy. It will be necessary to prepare a system of
telegraphic signs and symbols which shall indicate the Chinese
charters. It is proposed to have the students here in learning the art
to use the ordinary system of this country, and as they are well
acquainted with English they could in their country either telegraph
in English and translate in Chinese or use the proposed Chinese
telegraphic symbols. The students selected for the telegraphic class
are those who are most advanced in their studies in this country and
who are shortly to return to China. G. B. Hubbell, who has recently
resigned the position of Hartford manager of the Western Union Company
has been engaged as instructor.
