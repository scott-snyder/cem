Too Rapid for the Mongolians.

Cheyenne, July 26. The Leader to-morrow will contain an interview with
Tzu Seon Kee, an attache of the Chinese embassy at Washington. He says
that the Chinese students withdrawn from America will be sent to
England, France and Germany. They number one hundred. The Chinese
Government will hereafter educate students in Europe and China, where
military and naval schools are being established. The inference drawn
by the interviewer is that the Chinese Government fears the
progressiveness of American institutions. Tzu Seon Kee says the new
embassy, headed by Zum Tzou Roo, will go to Washington in December.
