Imperative orders from a commissioner of the Chinese government have
been received by three Celestial students at Lafayette college to
report in New York tomorrow to be with one hundred and seventeen other
Chinese students taken back to China. All the students are charged by
the commissioner, who is prejudiced against the American customs, with
abandoning their national political views and religion and becoming
Americanized.  The young students are loth to go, but have no
alternative.
