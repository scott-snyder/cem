Why Chinese Students Leave America.

Twenty-five Chinese students, on their way from Hartford to their
homes, arrived in Chicago yesterday. They say they have completed the
studies which they were sent on to master. One reason they give for
being summoned home is that the government's military and naval
academies are closed to them. As Germany allows them to enter their
institutions, China will probably send her students thither hereafter,
and to England. They state that none of their party have changed their
faith In America They were dressed well and spoke English well.
