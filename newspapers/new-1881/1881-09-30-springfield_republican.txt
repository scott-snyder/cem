The last installment of 27 Chinese students, with Commissioner Woo,
left Hartford for San Francisco, by way of this city, this week, en
route for China. They went by a special Wagner coach. One student is
left behind because of illness. A large crowd saw the party off. The
mission house is closed and left in charge of Yung Wing, who will
remain until December, when the new commissioner will reach this
country. Each of the departing students wore appropriate emblems of
mourning for this countryâ€™s bereavement.
