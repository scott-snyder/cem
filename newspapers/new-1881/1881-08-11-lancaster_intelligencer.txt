The first party of twenty-five Chinese students who left Hartford for
their homes arrived in Chicago yesterday. They said they had finished
the studies for which they were sent to this country. One reason given
by them for being summoned home is that the military and naval
academies in this country are closed to them. As Germany allows them
to enter her institutions, they will probably be sent hereafter to
that country or to England. Nine of their party have changed their
faith (become Christians?) in America.
