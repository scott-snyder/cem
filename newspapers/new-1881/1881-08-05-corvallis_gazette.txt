Boston, July 30.--The Journal publishes the reason which actuated the
Chinese government in recalling its young men who were students at
Hartford. It seems that the emperor a year ago dispatched a mandarin
of high rank to Hartford to enquire into the workings of the
educational commission.  This individual has never been outside the
limits of his native land and possesses only book knowledge of foreign
customs. On reaching Hartford he was horrified at finding that the
wards of his nation had become Americanized to an alarming degree,
some being so far acclimated as to have parted with their pig
tails. The shock was too great for the nerves of the conservative
functionary. Yung Wing, the able head of the commission, failed in his
efforts to clear away the prejudice of his visitor, who declared that
the effect of their sojourn was to alienate the boys from their
country and its customs: to undermine the most sacred traditional
principles of the government and society, and to implant and foster
seditious ideas which would become the germ of social if not civil and
religious discords among their own people. The whole influence and
tendency of the mission was pernicious and dangerous in the
extreme. He therefore recommended immediate abandonment of the
enterprise and recall of all the students, and this course has been
adopted by the home government.
