The Chinese students in America are starting for home. Twenty-two
passed through Omaha on one train. One of the reasons for this action
by the Chinese government was the refusal on the part of the United
States government to admit them to the naval school at Annapolis and
the West Point Military academy.  The Chinese government will
hereafter send its students to Germany and England, where military
schools are not closed against them.  There are yet forty Chinese
students at Harvard, twenty-six at Yale, and the rest are divided
between Cornell, Lafayette and Columbia, all of whom will soon start
for home.
