The emigrant passage for the west, was unusually heavy
yesterday. There were five cars in all including one car of
Chinese. These latter were a weird looking set with their shallow,
marked faces, eager eyes and numerous gestures keeping time to an
equally fantastic tongue.

The car of Chinese on the emigrant train, yesterday, attracted
considerable attention from the platform gang.  Said one bystander:
"Those are the Chinese students, aren’t they?" To which another, "Yes,
hard looking customers, those." And a third, with all the sage gravity
of personified wisdom, remarked: "Well, it don’t do any good to educate
those cusses, anyhow."  And he gazed through his cigar smoke with
evident satisfaction with Yankee superiority and pitying contempt for
the car of heathens which had inspired the remark.
