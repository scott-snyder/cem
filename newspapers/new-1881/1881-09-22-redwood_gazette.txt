â€”The Hartford Courant says of the Chinese students in this country
that when they have entered a school or college, or taken up a study,
they have forthwith proceeded to step to the head of the school and to
master the whole of the study. It has been amazing to see how, in a
strange country, speaking a foreign and peculiarly difficult language,
they have managed, in so many ways on so many occasions, to beat their
American boy associates.
