Title: Signs of Decay in China.

Signs of Decay in China.
Cincinnati Gazette.

The continued rise of the Chinese Empire for a period of eight or ten
thousand years or so, according to Chinese history, seemed to have
proved that nation an exception to the common course of the lives of
empires, which have their beginning, rise, culmination, and decline
the same as human beings; but now even this oldest of empires is about
to start on the road to decay. Philosophers have remarked that one of
the earliest signs of national degeneracy is the loss of the martial
capacity. China is to fall in this line. Commissioner Woo, in charge
of the Chinese students in the United States, says that the government
has decided to adopt a military school system, modified after West
Point, and that the American tactics and manual of arms will be
adopted. Thus will the oldest of empires be done for. And thus the
beginning of her decay will date from her removal of her barrier which
excluded the evil communications of outside barbarians. A strange
whirligig, that the greatest of republics (France, not yet organic
enough to be counted) should cause the downfall of the oldest of
empires!
