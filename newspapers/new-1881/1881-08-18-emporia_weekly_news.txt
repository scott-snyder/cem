Chinese Students Going Home.

Chicago, August 10. Several Chinese students, on their way from
Hartford to their homes in China, arrived here to-day. They say they
have completed the studies for which they were sent to this
country. One reason they give for being summoned home is that the
government's military and naval academies are closed to them.  and as
Germany allows them to enter her institutions, China will probably
send her students thither hereafter and to England. They state that
none of their party have changed their faith in America. They were
well dressed and spoke English well and were a creditable looking set
of young men.
