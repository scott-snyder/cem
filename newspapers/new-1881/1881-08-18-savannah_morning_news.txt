The party of Chinese students who have started from this country for
home are to be employed in the establishment of a telegraph line from
Shanghai to Pekin. They have recently been put to work studying
telegraphy, and are rapidly acquiring a knowledge of that art.
Telegraphing in Chinese, by the by, is impossible, in consequence of
the length of the Mongol alphabet, and English has to be used for that
purpose. The young Chinamen recently studying at the New England
college were sent to this country to acquire English so as to fit them
for the telegraph business.
