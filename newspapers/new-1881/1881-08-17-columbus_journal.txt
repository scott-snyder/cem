Twenty-five Chinese students, on their way from Hartford home, went
west last week. They say they have completed the studies for which
they were sent. One reason they gave for being summoned home is that
this government's military and naval academies are closed to them.  As
Germany and England allow them to enter their institutions, it is
probable they will go hither hereafter.
