The Reported Recall of Chinese Students a Canard.  Hartford, July
27.â€”Kwong Ki Chin, Chinese educational commissioner, does not credit
the despatch from Cheyenne to the effect that the students recalled by
the Chinese government from this country are to be sent to
Europe. Officials at headquarters here have had no such
intimations. They are simply ordered home with the students under
their charge.
