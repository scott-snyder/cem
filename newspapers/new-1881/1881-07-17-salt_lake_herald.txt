Why the Chinese Most Go Home.

New York 16,---Hartford dispatch says the abolition of the Chinese
educational commission and the recall of the students in this country
is a matter which has been under consideration by the present
government of China for many months. The step has been taken because
of fear upon the part of the home authorities that the progress made
by students in matters outside of strictly educational work in schools
is not to be of advantage to the Chinese future. The young men who
have come here only for the purpose of learning our language in order
to have free advantage in our schools have gone so much farther in
their advances in all directions that it has attracted the serious
attention of home rulers. The whole tendency of the studies has been
to liberalize the students, just what the home authorities do not want
as they see in it grave possible complications in the future. A large
amount of money has been expended since the work begun in 1872 and at
the present time the expenses to the China government in taking care
of students alone, saying nothing of contingent expenses, is over
$100,000 a year.
