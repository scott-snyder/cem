Talk With the Chinese Students.â€” Twenty-five Chinese students, on
their way from Hartford to their home, arrived in Chicago on Wednesday
last. They say that they have completed the studies for which they
were sent. One reason they give for being summoned is that this
Government's military and naval academies are closed to them. As
Germany allows them to enter her institutions, China will probably
send her students thither hereafter or to England. They state that
nine of their party have changed their faith in America. They were
well-dressed and spoke English well.
