Chinese Studying Telegraphy.

New York, June 18th.---A Hartford special says: The Chinese Government
recently sent instructions through the Embassy at Washington to the
Chinese Educational Commission in this city to establish a class of
telegraphy, and operations will be commenced next week. At present
there is no telegraphic communication in the Chinese Empire excepting
between a few of the larger places on the coast. It is understood that
the communication is to be solely English, or in other tongues than
Chinese, and that no system has yet been devised by which Chinese
could communicate by wire in their own language. The project, as
reported here, contemplates the establishment of a Governmental
telegraphic system, to extend to all of the Empire, with operators who
are to be thoroughly instructed alike in the theory and the practical
operation of the electric telegraph. It will be necessary to prepare a
system of telegraphic signs and symbols which shall indicate the
Chinese characters. It is proposed to have students here, in learning
the art, use the ordinary system of this country, and, as they are
well acquainted with English, they could in their own country either
telegraph in English and translate into Chinese, or use the proposed
system of Chinese telegraphic symbols.
