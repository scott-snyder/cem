New York, July 16.â€”A Hartford dispatch says the abolition of the
Chinese Educational Commission and the recall of students in this
country is a matter that has been under consideration by the present
Government of China for many months. The step has been taken because
of fear on the part of the home authorities that the progress made by
the students in matters outside of strictly educational work in
schools, is not to be of advantage to the Chinese future. The young
men who have come here only for the purpose of learning our language,
have the free advantages of our schools, and have gone so much farther

not want, as they see in it grave complications in the future.  A
large amount of money has been expended since the work began in 1872,

taking care of the students alone, saying nothing of the contingent
expenses, is over $100,000 a year,
