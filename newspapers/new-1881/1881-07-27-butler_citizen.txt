â€”It is reported that the Chinese Government is about to close the
school at Hartford; that all Chinese students and their Chinese
teachers have been ordered to return to their native country. Such an
order is a natural sequence of the great change of policy now taking
place in China. This Empire, like that of Russia, is turning its back
on Occidental ideas, and is seeking to get back to the old paths of
national government. And perhaps both are quite in the right. Every
country must grow from within. The amount of wholesome stimulus it can
receive from foreign nations is limited. The danger is that in trying
to adopt their civilization it may achieve nothing but a lifeless
caricature, or may import a hortus siccus of foreign notions and
methods which have no root in its own soil. We do not doubt that there
in a standard in these things, by which our own civilisation is better
than that of China, and the civilization of England or Germany than
that of Russia. But China and Russia must win their way to the higher
level through their history and experience. No one can import these
gains of our civilization into other countries, as if in bales or
buckets.  We would rather see China exhibit this natural jealousy,
than see Japan abandoning all her own history and character in order
to make herself a second rate copy of Europe or America.
