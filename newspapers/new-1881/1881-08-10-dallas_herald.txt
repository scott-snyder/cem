Chinese Students Going Home.
Philadelphia Times.

The Chinese Legation interpreter, Chi, is authority for the statement
that the withdrawal of Chinese students from American colleges is not
because of any intention to place them either in Germany and England
or under any other foreign government.  Arrangements have recently
been perfected at home whereby the same advantages can be given as are
offered in this country, Prof.  Cummings. an American, is at present
conducting a school of naval officers in China, and it is proposed by
the Chinese government to broaden this naval school so as to include
instruction in telegraphy. the living languages, military tactics,
etc. It will be located at Tsyien. Much annoyance has been experienced
at the Chinese embassy by the various rumors and speculations that
have found their way into print The legation has been specially
annoyed by the statement that the students were ordered home because
they were imbibing too much American liberty. While it is not denied
that the students are apt to fall too much in love with our
institutions to be entirely tractable at home, but the home government
was fully aware of this danger before sending them here. It was by no
means to be taken as an indication of unpleasant relations between the
two governments, as Americans would probably be the leading teachers
at home. The new Minister is expected shortly. Some of the present
legation will remain. The rest will be sent on other Missions.
