Why the Chinese Students Must Go Home.

A recent Easton (Pa.) dispatch says: "Four years ago, through the
influence of the Chinese Ambassador, 120 young Chinamen were sent to
this country by the Celestial Government to be educated. Three of them
came to Lafayette College, and their studious habits, intelligence,
vivacity and gentlemanly deportment have caused them to be great
favorites. Last evening they received sudden and imperative orders to
return to China, and are compelled to leave here to-morrow for New
York, whence they will immediately take passage for home.  The Chinese
Commission sent over here to examine and report on the progress, etc.,
of the students has full power to act, and is not in any way
responsible to the Ambassador. The Ambassador was reported to have
endeavored to induce the Commissioner to allow the students to remain
and graduate, but the Commissioner is said to have reported to his
Government that the students have adopted American habits, discarding
every distinctive sign of nationality, hiding their queues, dropping
the use of their native tongue and failing to observe the customs or
religion of Confucius. Therefore he has ordered the whole company of
120 to return, and there is no appeal."
