Title: The Chinese Students.

The Chinese Students.

New York, August 6.â€”The Post's Washington special says: It is reported
that instructions have been received from the Chinese government
modifying the original order for the return of the Chinese students in
this country. It is believed at any rate that this order will
ultimately be reconsidered.  There is a suspicion that the refusal of
our government to permit the Chinese youth to enter our military
schools in large numbers had something to do with the recall.
