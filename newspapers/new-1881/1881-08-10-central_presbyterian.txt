The Hartford Courant says of the Chinese students in this country that
when they have entered a school or college, or taken up a study, they
have forthwith proceeded to step to the head of the school and to
master the whole of the study. It has been amazing to see how in a
strange country, speaking a foreign and peculiarly difficult language,
they have managed in so many ways on so many occasions to beat their
American boy associates.

The secret, we suspect, is this: the Chinese are thorough, and they
are patient. They are not afraid of details.  They are not easily
bored. They look upon work as the normal state of man.
