The Chinese Students and Their Arrival Home.

The Chinese students recalled from Connecticut and elsewhere in this
country are some of them already back in the celestial empire. The
first detachment to arrive was a party of forty telegraphers, who were
immediately detailed to Tien Tein for telegraphic duty, it is
supposed. Another detachment which arrived later were ordered into
close confinement in an old college building, in order that the
authorities might examine them and see if they had brought along any
knowledge that would not be appreciated in the empire.
