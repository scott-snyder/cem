The Chinese Students.

Cheyenne Wyo 26.--The Leader to-morrow will contain an interview with
Tsu Soon Kee, attache of the Chinese embassy at Washington. He says
the Chinese students withdrawn from America will be sent to England
France and Germany. They number 100 Chinese.  The government will
hereafter educate students in Europe and China where military and
naval schools are being established. The inference drawn by the
interviewer is that the Chinese government fears the progressiveness
of American institutions Tsu Soon Kee says the new embassy headed by
Jum Tsau Roo will go to Washington in December
