The prospect of an immediate recall of the Chinese students and
instructors causes considerable sorrow here in Hartford. They have
been very entertaining and agreeable and the commission, directly and
indirectly, has brought considerably money to the purses of many of
our merchants and others with whom they have done business. All in
all, their presence is very desirable. The officials at the commission
have been in daily expectation of orders to return home at once since
the new minister to America was appointed. Many think the fear of an
immediate recall unnecessary, but that some change is to be made is
not doubted. The 100 students are scattered about in Massachusetts and
Connecticut towns and a few are in college.  The class in telegraphy
has about finished its studies and in a few weeks the boys under
instruction will be ready to become teachers in China. It now looks as
though ex-Manager Hubbell of the Western Union line, who has been the
telegraphic instructor, would go to China to superintend the
government lines. It is said that Yung Wing, the assistant ambassador,
will have to return to China, for at least a temporary stop. His long
residence in this country and his acquaintance with our customs has
made him more of an American than a Chinaman. He has an American woman
for a wife and is naturalized. At present he is having a handsome
residence built just over the line in West Hartford.
