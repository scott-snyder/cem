It is now said that the motive of the Chinese Government in the
withdrawal of the Chinese students from this country, is a fear of the
growth of a respect for free institutions among them. They are, to
avoid this danger, to be transferred to England, France and
Germany. But as France is a republic, this alleged reason does not
seem to be wholly truthful. It is quite probable that European envy of
the trade between China and this country is at the bottom of the
change, European merchants believing that the education of Chinese
youth here would, in time, operate toward an extension of such trade.
