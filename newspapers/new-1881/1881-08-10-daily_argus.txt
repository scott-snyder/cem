CHINA STUDENTS.

Chicago, Aug. 10. Twenty-five Chinese
students on their way from Hartford have
arrived to-day. They say they have completed their studies for which they were
sent. One reason assigned for their being
summoned home is that the government
military naval academies are closed to
them. As Germany allows them to enter
her institutions, China will probably send
her students thither hereafter and to England. They state
that none of their party
have changed their faith in America. They
were well dressed, spoke English well and
were a creditable looking set of young men.
