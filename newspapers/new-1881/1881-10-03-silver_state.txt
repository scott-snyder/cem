Chinese Students.

Twenty-three young Chinamen, who
have been attending school at Hartford, Connecticut, passed
through yesterday. on their way to the Flowery
Kingdom. They had two Chinese servants, and were
in charge of two Chinese commissioners. Though dressed
in American style, they wore the pigtail. They are the last of the many
Chinese students who came to the
United States to study the customs of
the "barbarians," some years ago. A
young white woman of rather prepossessing appearance, who was
a passenger
on the same train, flirted with one
of the students and promenaded the
sidewalk with him while the train remained here, causing
considerable comment among by-standers, who are not
yet thoroughly imbued with the social
equality ideas which prevail in the
Eastern States.
