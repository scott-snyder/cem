The Chinese Students.

It is announced at the Chinese Legation at Washington that next Monday
Yung Wi Chang, the Assistant Commissioner of Education, will start for
China with another party of Chinese students, numbering forty. It is
said that in September Commissioner Woo will return with the rest and
the establishment will be closed up and deserted.  Yung Wi Chang says
that he thinks his government will eventually send on another lot of
boys to be educated. He denies that his government is removing the
students because they are becoming Americanized, but he says that the
boys came here when about 10 years old and now have grown up until
they all range from 19 to 21 years of age and it is time some use is
being made of them.  They will he put to work on the new telegraph
line from Pekin to Tientsin.  Some of them, he says, who have been
here since they were 10 years old have forgotten their own language to
such an extent that they can with difficulty carry on a conversation
in it.  He says, further, that the Chinese Government in decided to
adopt a military school system modeled after West Point and it will be
located at Tientsin.
