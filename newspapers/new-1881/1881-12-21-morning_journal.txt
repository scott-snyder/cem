  "You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,
   But the scent of its rose will hang 'round it still."

Which leads to the remark that the Chinese students have gone, but
after having left many cents here have left their name to one of the
finest scents hanging 'round the olfactory sense of this
community---that of the Chinese Cologne; which for a few cents, in
comparison to the sense of pleasure it gives, can be had
everywhere. Scent it, sense it, send cents for it.---Hartford Globe.

The same Cologne is for sale by Brown, Bolton & Co., where there is a
fountain from which it is supplied free to visitors.
