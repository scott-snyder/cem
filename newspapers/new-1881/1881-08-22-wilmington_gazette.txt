Yung Wi Talks About His Students.

Washington, August 20.â€”It is announced at the Chinese legation that
next Monday Yung Wi Chaing, the Assistant Commissioner of Education,
will start for China with another party of Chinese students, numbering
forty. It is said that in September Commissioner Woo will return with
the rest and the establishment at Hartford will be closed up and
deserted. Yung Wi Chaing says that he thinks his government will
eventually send another lot of boys to be educated. He denies that his
government is removing the students because they are becoming
Americanized, but he says that the boys came here when about 10 years
old and now have grown up till they all range from 19 to 21 years of
age and it is time that some use is being made of them. The will put
to work on the new telegraph line from Pekin to Tie Tsin. Some of
them, he says, have forgotten their own language lo such extent that
they can with difficulty carry on a conversation in it. He says,
further, that the Chinese Government has decided to adopt a military
school system modeled after West Point and it will be located at
Tien-Tsin.
