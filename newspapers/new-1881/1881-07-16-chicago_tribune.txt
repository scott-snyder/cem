THE CHINESE STUDENTS.

Hartford, July 15.â€”The abolition of the, Chinese Educational
Commission and recall of the students in this country is a matter
which has been under consideration by the present Government of China
for many months. The step has been taken because of a fear upon the
part of the home authorities that the progress made by the students on
matters outside of strictly educational work in the schools, is not to
be of advantage to the Chinese future. The young men who have come
here only for the purpose of learning our language in order to have
the free advantage of our schools have gone so much further in their
advances in all directions that it has attracted the serious attention
of the home rulers. The whole tendency of the movement has-been, to
liberalize the students; what the authorities do not want, as they see
in grave possible complications In the future. A large amount of money
has been expended since the work began in 1873, and at the present
time, the expense to the Chinese Government in taking care of the
students alone, saying nothing of contingent expenses, is over
$100,000 a year.
