Woo Kia Shin, Han Lin, the Chinese commissioner, who reports in favor
of the return of the Chinese students now in America, seems to be
unable to draw the dividing line between the sense and the nonsense of
their scholastic service.  He thinks the boys have learned enough that
is good and are on the verge of much that is bad. In a word, that they
are absorbing too many of our American follies. Possibly Mr. Woo Kia
Shin, Han Lan, may have obtained an inkling of the conduct of the
Cornell crew, and deems it best to razee the collegiate Chinamen for
the reason given by the "orator" in the minstrels, who wanted ail
colleges destroyed, "because we have oarsmen enough." If Mr.  Shin had
permitted them to remain, however, they might have become athletes as
well as princes of learning in their native land, and have eliminate
at home whatever of badness they might have absorbed from the
curriculums of our American colleges. As it is, it is sorrowful that
they. will never know how to handle a spoon oar.
