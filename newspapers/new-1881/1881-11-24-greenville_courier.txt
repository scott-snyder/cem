---The Pacific reports an interesting incident occurring at San
Francisco, on board the "City of Peking,' which took out out recent
missionary reinforcements to North China. On the same vessel were some
fifty of the Chinese students ordered home by their government, who,
after giving cheers for various friends they were leaving, took up the
hymn. "My country, 'tis of thee," and sang it with a will, inviting
others to join with them. W\e look for no explosions following the
return of these young men to their native land.  We may hear nothing
about them, possibly, for some time to come. But that they will be a
power in China, infusing a new life into the mass already deeply
stirred, who can doubt? They may prove to be in some sort missionaries
for Christ. as efficient, possibly, as our brethren who sailed with
them, girded for a divine service, though they now know it not.
