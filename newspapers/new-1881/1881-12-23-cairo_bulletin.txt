Letters received at Hartford. Conn., from China since the arrival home
of the Chinese students, say that the first party of forty had been
ordered to Tien-Tsin for telegraph work while the other, who reached
Shanghai early in October, were at once confined in an old building in
a remote part of the town, the government's intention being apparently
to examine them before they had a chance to scatter to their homes.
