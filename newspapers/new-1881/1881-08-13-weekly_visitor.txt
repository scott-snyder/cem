Title: THE CHINESE STUDENTS.

THE CHINESE STUDENTS.

The withdrawal of the Chinese students by order of their government
will not argue in favor of laws to protect and encourage immigration
from the Flowery Land. The arguments of those who hitherto have
opposed such legislation, chief of which was the assertion that the
Chinese do not intend to become American citizens, are strengthened by
this summary recall, which appears to have been made for no other
reason than that the students were becoming familiar with the ways of
this country. These young men were, with possibly few exceptions, the
sole representatives we had of the better classes of the Chinese and
their departure leaves only those who were brought over under the
coolie system, and who will stay with us long enough to earn what
constitutes a competency in their own country and no longer.

We believe in giving the protection of the laws to all the Chinese who
may come here; they have as much right to that protection as any other
foreigner. But inasmuch as they have repeatedly shown a determination
to shrink from the duties of citizenship, for which, by the way,
viewing the immorality and general turpitude of the lower classes, we
should be thankful, we hold that not only is Congress bound in no
manner to encourage their immigration, but that prudence, and the
claims of the Occidental States, should limit and, as far as possible,
prevent it.
