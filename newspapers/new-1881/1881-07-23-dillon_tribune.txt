The China Schools.

A Hartford dispatch says the abolition of the Chinese educational
commission and the recall of the students in this country is a matter
which has been under consideration by the present government of China
for many months. The step, has been taken because of the fear upon the
part of the home authorities that the progress made by students in
matters outside of the strictly educational work in the schools is not
to be of advantage to the Chinese future. The young men who have come
here only for the purpose of learning our language, in order to have
free advantage in our schools, have gone so much farther in their
advances in all directions that it has attracted the serious attention
of our home rulers. The whole tendency of the studies has been to
liberalize the students, which is what the home authorities do not
want, as they see in it grave possible complications in the future.  A
large amount of money has been expended since the work began in 1872,
and at the present time the expense to China just in taking care of
the students alone, saying nothing of contingent expenses is over
$100,000 a year.
