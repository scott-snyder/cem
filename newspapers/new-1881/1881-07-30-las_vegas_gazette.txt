Afraid of Freedom.

New York, July 29. Just why the Chinese government has seen lit to
recall its young men who have been studying in this country is not
clear, but that they are to continue their studies in England, France
and Germany is denied by Kwong Ki Chin, the educational commissioner
at Hartford. He says the report that Tsu Soon Kee, an attache of the
Chinese embassy at Washington, had said that the students were to be
sent to Europe, is undoubtedly false, for he had talked long with Tsu
last week on the subject, and nothing of the kind was hinted at. Kwong
Ki Chin does not, however, deny the inference that his government
fears the progressiveness of American institutions.
