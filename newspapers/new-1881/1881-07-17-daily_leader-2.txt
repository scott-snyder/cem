A New York Times Hartford special says: There is a probability that
the promising educational scheme which the Chinese government has been
trying in this country for the pest ten years, will speedily come to
an end.  There is reason to believe that the Chinese ambassador to
this country has been superseded by a new minister who is instructed
to put a stop to the educational project, and have all those connected
with it, students, instructors and attendants sent back to China.  The
headquarters of the commission has always been in this city, where it
owns a fine building for a residence.  There are at least one hundred
men in this country, about fifty being in various colleges, while the
others are in preparatory schools. They are picked boys of good
families and have exhibited great aptitude for study, and have made
themselves favorites everywhere.  The abandonment of the enterprise,
if it is decided upon, will occasion much regret. It was originated by
Yung Wing, himself a graduate of Yale, and one of most progressive
Chinese statesmen of the age; he has resided in this country during
the past ten years, and with the sanction of his government has adopted
American dress, married an American wife, an intelligent lady of Avon,
in this state. For several years he has been associated with Chin Lan
Pin, in charge of the Chinese embassy, to this country. It Is reported
that both these gentlemen are to return to China, and that the first
boys to be returned will be those of the recently formed school of
telegraphy.
