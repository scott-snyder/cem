The first party of twenty-five Chinese student have left Hartford for
their homes. They said they had finished the studies for which they
were sent to this country. One reason given by them for being summoned
home is that the military and naval academies in this country are
closed to them. As Germany allows them to enter her institutions, they
will probably he sent hereafter to that country or to England.  Nine
of their party have changed their faith (become Christians?) in
America.
