Chinese Students Going Home.---A telegram from Hartford, Conn.,
September 26. says: "The Chinese Educational Commission Home,
established in this city several years ago, finally closed its doors
to-day. The last party of students, twenty-seven in number, started for
China, in charge of Commissioner Woo and one of the teachers and
servants. The fine building, erected here by the Chinese government
two years ago, will be sold. Mr. Yung Wing, attached to the Chinese
legation, and and who has fostered this educational enterprise since
its inception, remains in this country for the present, but it is
expected to return to China next winter, after the arrival at
Washington of the Chinese minister, who has been recently appointed."
