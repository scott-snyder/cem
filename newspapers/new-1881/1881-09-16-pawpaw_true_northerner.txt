The cause of the sudden recall home of the Chinese students sent to
America to be educated is at last satisfactorily explained. The whole
cause of complaint lay in the absence at the University of rat
food. The authorities of the Celestial empire never dreamed that the
bright youths of their land would be weaned from their national dish
on this side of the water, and when the pig tailed students wrote home
that they were dosed on hashy-hashy, hashy-hashy every day the rage of
the Chinese officials knew no bounds. The pupils complained that since
their arrival not a drop of rat soup nor a morsel of fried, stewed or
roasted rodent had passed their fevered lips, and they just couldn't
nor wouldn't stand it---so there, now!  They even averred that the
exercises were opened in the morning with a national anthem,
beginning:

  Oh, hash, thou delight of my soul,
    Without thee this world would be gloomy;
  How I love thy sweet entrance to roll
    Down into my inwards so roomy!
  Thou mixture mysterious, I love
    The fragrance of onions about thee,
  And where'er on this earth I may rove
    I pray I may ne'er be without thee.

When this was interpreted in the royal court the decree went forth and
the festive young men are now back in their own land, where rats are
as plenty as oldest Masons are in America.
