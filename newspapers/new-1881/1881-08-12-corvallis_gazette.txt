The Post's Washington special says it is reported that instructions
have been received from Chinese governments, modifying the original
order for the return of the Chinese students in this country. There is
a suspicion that the refusal of our government, to permit Chinese
youth to attend our military schools in large numbers, had some thing
to do with the recent action of the home government.
