A Boss John.

New York 13.--The Tribune: There can be no little doubt that the order
for the return of the Chinese students is due to the deposition from
power of Prince Tso Tsung Seng who is now minister of war and what is
more to the purpose the popular idol, with an enormous and victorious
army to back him, which has been drilled and equipped under his
personal supervision in a manner totally without precedent in the
history of China. This remarkable man is exercising as powerful an
influence over the present Asiatic policy as Cromwell did in England
or Napoleon in France.
