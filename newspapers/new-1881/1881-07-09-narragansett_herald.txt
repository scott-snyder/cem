The Chinese government has come to the conclusion that its telegraph
lines might better be under its own management than in the hands of
enterprising foreigners; and the preliminary steps to that end have
been taken in the establishment of a school of telegraphy in
Hartford. The Chinese embassy at Washington recently received
instructions to form a class of forty from among the Chinese students
in Hartford, and Mr. Yung Wing has just chosen its members and placed
them under the charge of Mr. Hubbell, late manager of the Hartford
office of the Western Union company. A class-room has been furnished
with every requisite appliance, and Mr. Hubbell expects that within
two months the students under his instructions will be competent to
teach others. As soon as they have attained the requisite proficiency
they will be ordered home, and probably accompanied by a few skilled
Americans to superintend the construction and operation of new
telegraph lines.
