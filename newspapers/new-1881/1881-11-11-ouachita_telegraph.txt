The young Chinese students who have been recalled by the home
government, and who made a halt in San Francisco on the way, attracted
in that city by the fashionable cut of their clothes and their general
appearance of elegance and refinement. They especially provoked the

regarded them as the aristocrats of the Flowery Kingdom.  They were
treated with much courtesy wherever they went.
