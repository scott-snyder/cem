Chinese Education to be Stopped.

New York, July 15.---Says the Times' Hartford special: There is a
probability that the promising educational scheme which the Chinese
Government has been trying in this country for the past ten years,
will speedily come to an end. There is reason to believe that the
Chinese Ambassador to this country has been superceded by a new
minister, who is instructed to put a stop to the educational project,
and have those connected with, it, students, instructors and
attendents sent back to China.  The headquarters of the commission has
always been in this city, where it owns a fine building for a
residence.  There are at least one hundred young men in the country,
about fifty being in various colleges, while the others are in
preparatory schools. They are picked boys of good families, and have
exhibited great aptitude for study, and have made themselves favorites
everywhere. The abandonment of the enterprise, if it is decided upon,
will occasion much regret.  It was originated by Yung Wang himself, a
graduate of Yale, and one of the most progressive Chinese statesmen of
the age. He has resided in this country during the past ten years, and
with the sanction of his government adopted the American dress,
married an American wife, an intelligent lady of Avon, in this
State. For several years he has been associated with Chin Lan Pin, in
charge of the Chinese embassy to this country. It is reported that
both these gentlemen are to return to China, and that the first boys
to be returned will be those of the recently formed school of
telegraph.
