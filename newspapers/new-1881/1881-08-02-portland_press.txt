According to the Boston Journal the Chinese commissioner sent to this
country to look after the Chinese students here "was greatly shocked
to see how the spirit of our institutions had been caught up by the
youths from China. They had in some instances disposed of their
queues, and, with the exception of physiognomical peculiarities, they
were to all intents and purposes Americans, without political
privileges."
