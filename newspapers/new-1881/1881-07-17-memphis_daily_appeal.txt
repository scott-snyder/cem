Recall of the Chinese Students.

New York. July 16.---The Time's Hartford dispatch says: "The abolition
of the Chinese Educational Commission and the recall of the students
in this country is a matter which has been under consideration by the
present Government of China for many months. The step has been taken
because of the fear on the part of the home authorities the progress
made by the students on matters outside of strictly education work is
not to be of advantage to the Chinese of the future. The young men
have come here only for the purpose of learning our language in order
to have free advantage of our schools have gone much further in their
advances in all directions.
