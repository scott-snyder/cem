Celestials Started.  Twenty-two of the Chinese students left Hartford
yesterday afternoon under charge of Professor Yung for San Francisco,
and will sail for home directly after their arrival in that
city. Kwong Ki Chin, author of the work on English Phrases, will not
return with the mission. He will remain here for a considerable
period, as he is engaged on another important literary enterprise.
