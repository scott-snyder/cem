Title: The Chinese Students.

The Chinese Students.

It is reported that instructions have been received from the Chinese
Government modifying the original order for the return of the Chinese
students in this country. It is believed at any rate that this order
will be ultimately reconsidered. There is a suspicion that the refusal
of our Government to permit the Chinese youth to enter our military
schools in large numbers had something to do with the recent action of
their home Government; that it is true that the boys showed an in
subordinate disposition which rather alarmed the Special
Commissioners.
