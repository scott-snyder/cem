CHINESE MUST GO.

A party of sixty Chinese students, who have been educated at Hartford,
Conn., by their government, passed through the city yesterday on their
way to the Pacific coast. They were all dressed in the most stylish
American-cut garments, and in conversation appeared both cultured and
refined. They are traveling in state, having special Pullman coaches
to San Francisco over the Rock Island and Pacific railroad.  The
students expressed themselves as highly pleased with the country, and
especially with the educational facilities. They were surprised with
the West, as they had been induced to believe that the better part of
the United States was located in the East. They considered that the
impression was false, as they were particularly struck with the great
resources of the Mississippi valley.
