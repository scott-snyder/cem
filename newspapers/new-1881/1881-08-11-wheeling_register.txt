The Chinese Students.

Chicago, August 10.â€”Twenty-five Chinese students on their way home
from Hartford arrived here to-day.  They say they have completed the
studies for which they were sent. One reason they give for being
summoned home is that this government's military and naval academies
are closed to them.  As Germany allows them to enter her institutions
China will probably send her students thither hereafter and to
England. They state that none of their party have changed their faith
in America. They were well dressed, spoke English. well and were
creditable looking men.
