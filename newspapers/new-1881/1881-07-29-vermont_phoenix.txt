Tsu Soon Kee, an attache of the Chinese embassy at Washington, says
that tho Chinese students withdrawn from America will be sent to
England, France and Germany. They number 100. The Chinese government
will hereafter educate students in Europe and China, where military
and naval schools are being established. It is inferred from what he
said that the Chinese government fears the progressiveness of American
institutions.
