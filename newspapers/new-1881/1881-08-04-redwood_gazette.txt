At Cheyenne a few days ago an attache of the Chinese Embassy was
interviewed on the alleged withdrawal of Chinese students from
American schools. He stated that his Government would hereafter send
its young men to England, France or Germany, beyond the reach of the
progressive and destructive ideas taught in the United States.
