Mrs. Sieu Chin, wife of Kwang Ki Chin, official interpreter and
translator for the Chinese teachers and students at Hartford, died on
Monday, aged twenty-two. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant of
Canton, and was married five years ago, coming to America not quite
two years since.  She leaves a boy fifteen months old, to whom she was
most tenderly attached. Indeed, her devotion to the baby has made for
her many friends among her neighbors. "Who will love my little baby
now?" were her last words.
