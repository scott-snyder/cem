CHINESE STUDENTS IN AMERICA.

There are now ninety Chinese students gaining an education in
Massachusetts end Connecticut, at the expense of their
Government. Thirty of them have been in the country two years, thirty
came but a year ago, and the remaining thirty arrived recently, At
first, the students are placed two together, in private families, for
the purpose of learning the English language. Every twelve-month they
undergo an examination, lasting from two to four weeks, at the
headquarters of the Chinese Educational Committee In Hartford. The
uniform refinement and intelligence of those young men, their correct
habits, and their aptness and eagerness for acquiring knowledge,
elicit unqualified admiration. Two of them were lately admitted to
Yale Collage. Scientific Department, having passed a good
examination. The students are called "the Emperor's boys," from their
being under the Emperor's patronage,â€”each one receiving $700 per
annum for his expenses.
