Two Chinese students were admitted Tuesday to the Yale College
Scientific Department. They passed the examination, most creditably,
and give promise of superior a scholarship. There are now 60 Chinese
students supported by the government in Connecticut and
Massachusetts. 30 came two years ago, and 30 arrived a year since, and
30 more are expected in about a fortnight. So far, their deportment
has been excellent, and the progress quite remarkable. The students
are placed at first in cultured families, two in a place, where their
first aim is the mastery of our language. They are all under strict
supervision, and spend each from 2 to 4 weeks a year at the
“Headquarters” of the Chinese educational commission in Hartford where
they are carefully examined as to their habit and progress. Scattered
in some 20 or 30 different towns, these boys have everywhere been
favorites. The kindness with which they have been treated has been
very gratifying to the commission here, and to the Chinese government
at home.
