SPRINGFIELD AND VICINITY

The third delegation of Chinese students is expected in this city,
early in September; there will be 30 boys, ranging in years from 10 to
16, and they will be distributed as their predecessors have been.  All
of them have a slight knowledge of the English language. One other
delegation will follow, concluding the Chinese educational mission,
until the students already sent have been tried at home. The progress
of the boys has been good; in some cases, remarkably rapid.
