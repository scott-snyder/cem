A party of Chinese, thirty boys and five men passed through the city,
yesterday morning via the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railway. The
head man, who talks broken English, told our reporter, who talks
broken China, that the young pagans were bound for Springfield, Mass.,
and Hartford, Conn., where there are schools for them, maintained
under the auspices of the Chinese Educational Mission. They are sent
by the Chinese Government to be educated in this country. The boys
will be placed in the homes of American citizens, two in a family, so
that while they learn the English language perfectly, they may not
forget their own, as they will use it in conversing with each
other. The lads are selected from all classes and are very bright and
full of fun, even as Christian boys are. They are from twelve to
fifteen years of age, dressed in their national costume, tail and
all. They will remain in this country fifteen years, during which time
they remain under the supervision of a Chinese commissioner. This is
but another instance of the high appreciation which foreign nations
have of American intelligence, government, and educational system.
