Chinese Students.

There are in Hartford, Conn., sixty Chinese students attending school,
which number is to be increased by thirty-nine, who are on the way at
the present time from San Francisco, where they recently landed. These
pupils are sent to be educated in this country by the Chinese
Government, and are selected with care by competitive examinations
from the schools of Shanghai. The system of thoroughly educating a
number of the youths of that country in foreign institutions, must
bear the profitable fruits of civilization and intellectual progress
within a few years in China. The wish to have the young men educated
in itself speaks well for the progress of the Chinese Government,
which bears the expense of their school life.
