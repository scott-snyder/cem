There are now sixty Chinese students supported by their government in
Connecticut and Massachusetts. Thirty came two years ago, thirty
arrived a year since, and thirty more are expected in about a
fortnight. So far their deportment has been excellent and their
progress quite remarkable. The students are placed at first in
families, two in a place, where their first aim is the mastery of our
language. They are all under strict supervision and spend each from
two to four weeks a year at the "Headquarters" of the Chinese
educational commission in Hartford, where they are carefully examined
as to their habits and progress.
