The American system of instruction seems to be entirely satisfactory
to tho Chinese government; at least a now installment of one hundred
students from China, to be educated in this country, will arrive next
month. Their course of study will have direct reference to government
service, civil, diplomatic, military or engineering. Several of the
students already here are about to make an effort to gain admission at
West Point and Annapolis.  In the course of another year, it is
stated, the Chinese government will also send students to Germany and
France to be educated. Tho Chinese have thus far proved themselves
hard students, devoting all their time to tho acquirement of
information, and within the next year at least fifty of them will
knock at the doors of our scientific schools and colleges for
admission, after having been in our country only two years.
