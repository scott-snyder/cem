The third delegation of Chinese students is expected in Springfield,
early in September; there will be 30 boys, ranging in years from 10 to
16, and they will be distributed as their predecessors have been. All
of them have a slight knowledge of the English language. One other
delegation will follow, concluding the Chinese educational mission,
until the students already sent have been tried at home. The progress
of the boys has been good; in some cases, remarkably
rapid. Mr. Laisun, the Chinese commissioner, noting the effect of the
special studies in some cases pursued, now contemplates gathering the
brightest of the Chinese boys scattered through this state and
Connecticut into Springfield for instruction in chosen branches of
study by Mr. Stebbins in his new collegiate institute. By this means
he hopes to shorten their term of study a year ... much, hasten their
return to China.
