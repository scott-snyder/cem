Title: Chinese Students.

Chinese Students From the Boston Traveller.

Two Chinese students were admitted Tuesday to the Yale College
Scientific Department. They passed the examination, most creditably,
and give promise of superior scholarship. There are now sixty Chinese
students supported by the government in Connecticut and
Massachusetts. Thirty came two years ago, and thirty arrived a year
since, and thirty more are expected in about a fortnight. So far,
their deportment has been excellent, and the progress quite
remarkable. The students are placed at first in cultured families, two
in a place, where their first aim is the mastery of our language. They
are all under strict supervision, and spend each from two to four
weeks a year at the “Headquarters” of the Chinese educational
commission in Hartford where they are carefully examined as to their
habit and progress. Scattered in some twenty or thirty different
towns, these boys have everywhere been favorites. The kindness with
which they have been treated has been very gratifying to the
commission here, and to the Chinese government at home.
