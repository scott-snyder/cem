The progress of civilization is forcibly illustrated by the growing
intimacy between such exclusive governments as China and Japan and the
more advanced governments of Europe, to say nothing of our own
Republic. At the last Yale College examination two Celestials were
admitted to the scientific department. They passed the examination
most creditably, and give promise of superior scholarship. We are also
informed by our Eastern exchanges that there are now sixty Chinese
students, supported by their government, in Connecticut and
Massachusetts. Thirty came two years ago, thirty arrived a year since,
and thirty more are expected in about a fortnight. So far their
deportment has been excellent and their progress quite
remarkable. They are all under strict supervision, and spend each from
two to four weeks a year at the Chinese Educational Commission in
Hartford, where they are carefully examined as to their habits and
progress.â€”[Denver Tribune.
