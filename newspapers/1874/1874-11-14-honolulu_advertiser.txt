MONGOLIAN PROGRESS.---Sixty Chinese students arrived at San Francisco
recently by the mail steamer Japan. Their ages range from 10 to 14
years, and they were in charge of two Commissioners and a teacher. The
students are destined for school at Hartford, Conn. The sixty Chinese
students now in Connecticut are divided into six divisions, and attend
different academies near Hartford, in which city there is a Chinese
school attended by the divisions, in succession, two weeks at a time,
thus giving the students two weeks of Chinese study for eight of
English.
