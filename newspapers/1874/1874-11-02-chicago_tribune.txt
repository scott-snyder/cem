Among certain things which the heathen Chinee is beginning to regard
as essential, in addition to wooden shoes and pig-tails, is a liberal
education, and nowhere can this be found so readily as in these United
States. Tho San Francisco Bulletin chronicles tho arrival in that city
of a ship-load of youthful Chinese, thirty in number. Their ages
ranged from 10 to 14 years.  They are in charge of two Government
Commissioners, and their ultimate destination is tho City of Hartford,
Conn. There are already sixty Chinese students in that little town,
attending tho numerous academies in tho neighborhood. The city
officials called on the party at their hotel, and speeches were made
by tho Commissioners in very good English.  They explained that tho
students, who were sent to this country at the Governmentâ€™s expense,
were selected by competitive examination from the schools in Shanghai,
which is the most important educational focus in the country.  The
consequence of this system is the choice of the brightest and most
promising children in China.  They are chosen without reference to the
social status of their parents, and rich and poor share equally in the
benefits of the system. This is republican enough to commend it. But
the satisfactory part of the arrangement is, that the boys are all
certified to be of good moral character. This is fortunate, for a bad
Chinese boy is the worst in the world, next to an American.
