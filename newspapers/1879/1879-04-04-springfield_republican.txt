RELIGIOUS INTELLIGENCE

The Chinese students in the seminary at Easthampton have formed an
association which they call the Chinese Christian home mission, the
object being to raise funds for sending missionaries to their own
country, and for building churches and establishing schools
there. Some of these students have been quite anxious to unite with
the Payson church, but they do not feel at liberty to do so while they
continue to be government students.
