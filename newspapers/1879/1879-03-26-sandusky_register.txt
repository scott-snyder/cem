Kwong Ki Chin, who is connected with the Chinese Educational Mission
at Hartford, Connecticut, commends Dr. Speer's letter on the Chinese
question in the very highest terms. Kwong Ki is vouched for by
prominent men in New England as a man of rare intelligence and
information and of unquestioned honesty. Of the anticipated flood of
Chinese which seems to have frightened Senator Blaine and
Representative Foster, he says that there is no reason to anticipate
any such flood, the official facts being that in 1877 and in 1878
several thousand and more Chinese returned home than arrived in
America. He confirms Dr. Speer's statements in regard to the six
companies and says that the Chinese immigrants to America are as free
to come and go as the Irish or Germans who come to this country. As to
their habits, he affirms that they are as cleanly as any other race,
and as particular and neat in their choice of food and in their
household manners.
