There were at one time two hundred and thirty Japanese students in the
United States, but only about twenty now remain. The number of Chinese
students in American educational institutions is one hundred and
twenty.  There are three Japanese girls at Vassar college, who have
entered upon their second year there, and one of them has been elected
president of the sophomore class. The Japanese government is training
them for teachers, and three more are expected in the country soon.
