"NEW YORK, April 21.â€”The Sun's Hartford special says a number of
changes in the management of the Chinese educational mission will take
place this week. In compliance with an order of the Emperor of China,
Ngau, who has been director with the rank of Mandarin of the fourth
class, has been recalled, and will return at once to China to assume a
position under a branch of home government, whose duties resemble
those of the Interior Department of the United States. Socially Ngau
and associates have been welcome guests in the most select circles in
Hartford. Kwong Ki Chin, the interpreter, must also return, but not
until he has finished his Chinese-English lexicon. To dine with Kwong
Ki Chin has been the desire of many eminent gentlemen in Hartford, but
in order to do so, it has been necessary to get the social endorsement
of Rev. J. Twichell or Mark Twain, and at Kwong Ki Chin's table it was
that ladies have sat down to eat with Chinese gentlemen. Ngau and his
associates feel encouraged at the success of the mission. Several of
the boys having already passed through preparatory schools, are in
college and all have won honors. On Friday last two more graduated at
the high school here, one received an oratorical prize, and both
delivered orations in the purest English."
