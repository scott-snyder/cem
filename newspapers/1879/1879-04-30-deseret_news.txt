NEW YORK, 21. â€” The Sun's Hartford special says: "A number of changes
in the management of the Chinese Educational Mission will take place
this week. In compliance with an order of the Emperor of China, Ngau,
who has been director, with the rank of mandarin of the fourth class,
has been recalled, and will return at once to China to assume a
position under a branch of home government whose duties resemble those
of the Interior Department of the United States. Socially, Ngau and
his associates have been welcome guests in the most select circles in
Hartford; Kwong Ki Chin, the interpreter, must also return, but not
until he has finished his Chinese-English lexicon. To dine with Kwong
Ki Chin has been the desire of many eminent gentlemen in Hartford, but
in order to do so it has been necessary to get the social endorsement
of Rev. J. Twitchell, or Mark Twain, and at Kwong Ki Chin's table it
was that ladies have sat down to eat with Chinese gentlemen. Ngau and
his associates feel greatly encouraged at the success of the
mission. Several of the boys, already passed through preparatory
schools, are in college, and all have won honors. On Friday last two
more graduated at the high school here, one received an oratorical
prize, and both delivered orations in the purest English."
