Jerseymen who are now residents of Philadelphia.  At noon Judges’ Hall
was crowded with a brilliant assemblage of visitors from New Jersey,
and Hon. Abram Browning was introduced by Gov.  Bedle as orator of the
day, who had been appointed under arrangement initiated by the
centennial commission for periodical addresses by orators from the
different States, descriptive of the history and resources of such
