The arrival of a Chinese Embassy at San Francisco en route to
Washington, is certainly a diplomatic event of no ordinary
importance. The Minister Plenipotentiary, CHIN LAN PIN, is no stranger
to our countrymen, having resided in the United States some years ago,
when he had in charge the Chinese Educational Mission, he attracted so
much attention at the time. Forty persons of high rank are attached to
his suite, and accompanying the party is a Consul-General, appointed
by the Peking Government to reside at San Francisco. The dispatches
state that on the arrival of these dignitaries there was no
representative of the municipal, State or Federal Government to
receive them, but that they proceeded to their hotel amidst the
salutations of an angry street mob.
