CHIN LAN PIN IN TOWN
The Chinese Ambassador on his way from Hartford to Washington

On the blotter of the Windsor Hotel last evening was the following
H. E. Chin Lan Pan, Chinese Embassy; H. E. Yung Wing; M Yeh, First
Secretary; M. Young, Second Secretary; Mr. Bartlett, American
Secretary; seven attaches and three servants.

The Embassy arrived last evening from Hartford, where they have been
visiting the Chinese Educational Mission, of which Yung Wing, who is a
graduate of Yale, has charge. The Mission owns a fine building in
Hartford, and contains upward of a hundred students, who are being
educated at the expense of the Chinese Government. Yung Wing has been
so long in this country that he has become thoroughly
Americanized. With his heavy moustache, short hair, and American
dress, he looks like anything but a Chinaman, and he speaks English
excellently. The party are going to Washington, where Chin Lan Pin
will present his credentials as Minister from China to the United
States. Chin Lan Pin, who, with the remainder of the Embassy, dresses
in the long robes peculiar to the celestial country, is a Mandarin of
high degree, and is of portly presence.  He wears a moustache and
imperial.  The party start for Washington this morning.
