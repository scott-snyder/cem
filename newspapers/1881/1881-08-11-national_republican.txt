The Chinese Going Home.

Chicago Aug 10.--Twenty-five Chinese students from Hartford on their
way home arrived here to-day. They say they have completed their
studies for which they were sent. One reason they gave for being
summoned home is that this Government's naval and military academies
are closed to them. As Germany allows them to enter her institutions,
China will probably send her students thither hereafter and to England
They state that nine of their party changed their faith in America
They were well dressed and spoke English well.
