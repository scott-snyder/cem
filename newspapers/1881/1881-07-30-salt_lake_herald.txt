The Chinese Students.

New York, 29.--Just why the Chinese government has seen fit to recall
its young men who have been studying in this country is not yet clear
but that they are to continue their studies in England, France and
Germany, is denied by Kwong Ki Chin. The educational commissioner at
Hartford.  He says the report that Tu Sing Kee, an attache of the
Chinese embassy at Washington, had said that the students were to be
sent to Europe is undoubtedly false for he had talked long with Tsing
last week and nothing of the kind was hinted. Kwong Ki Chin does not
deny the inference that the Chinese government fears the
progressiveness of American institutions.
