Chinese Students Recalled.

The abolition of the Chinese educational mission and recall of
students in this country is a matter which has been under
consideration of the present government in China for many months. The
step has been taken because of fear on the part of home authorities
that the progress made by students in matters outside of strictly
educational work in schools will not be of advantage to the Chinese in
the future. The young men who have come here only for the purpose of
learning our language in order to have free advantage of our schools,
have gone so much farther in their advances in all directions that it
has attracted the serious attention of home rulers. The whole tendency
of the government has been to liberalize the students, which the home
authorities do not want, as they see in it grave possible
complications in the future. A large amount of money has been expended
since the work begun in 1875, and at the present time the expense to
the Chinese government in taking care of students alone, to say
nothing of contingent expenses, is over $100,000 a year.
