Part of the recalled Chinese students leave Boston for China
Monday. They go West by way of Niagara Falls, and sail from San
Francisco for Yokohama, Japan, the 19th.

It is said that the breaking up of the Chinese educational mission was
caused by a native official wbo came to Hartford to investigate and
report the progress of the students. He was shocked, so runs the
story, because the youths were becoming thoroughly Americanized and in
some cases had discarded tbeir queues; and though Yung Wing tried hard
to overcome the paganâ€™s prejudices, he wrote home that it would never
do, as the sacred traditions of China were disregarded and the boys to
all intents were American heathen.
