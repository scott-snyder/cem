THE CHINESE STUDENTS.

Withdrawn Because of the Home Government's Fear of Their Learning Too Much.

New York, July 13.â€”The Times' Hartford dispatch says: The abolition of
the Chinese Educational Commission and the recall of the students in
this country is a matter which has been under consideration by the
present government of China for many months. The step has been taken
because of fear on the part of the home authorities the progress made
by the students on matters outside of strictly educational work in
schools is not to be of advantage to the Chinese of the future. The
young men who have come here only for the purpose of learning our
language in order to have free advantage of our schools have gone so
much further in their advances in all directions that it has attracted
the serious attention of the home rulers. The whole tendency of the
movement has been to liberalize the students, what home authorities do
not want, as they see in it grave possible complications in the
future. A large amount of money has been expended since the work begun
in 1872, and at the present time the expense to the Chinese government
in taking care of the students alone, saying nothing of the contingent
expenses, is over $100,000 a year.
