WITHDRAWAL OF CHINESE STUDENTS.

Cheyenne, Wy. T., July 26.--The Leader to-morrow will contain a report
of an interview with Tsu Soon Kee, an attache of the Chinese Embassy
at Washington. He says that the Chinese students withdrawn from
America will be sent to England, France, and Germany. They number
100. The Chinese Government will hereafter educate students in Europe
and also in China, where military and naval schools are being
established.  The inference drawn by the interviewer is that the
Chinese Government fears the progressiveness of American
institutions. Tsu Soon Kee says the new embassy, headed by Jam Tsau
Roo, will go to Washington in December.
