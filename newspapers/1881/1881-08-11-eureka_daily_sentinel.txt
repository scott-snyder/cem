Chinese Students Going Home.

Chicago, August 10.—The Chinese students, on their way from Hartford
home, arrived to-day. They say they have completed the studies for
which they were sent. One reason they give for being summoned home is
that the Government’s military and naval academies are closed to
them. As Germany allows them to enter her institutions, China will
probably send her students thither hereafter and to England. They
state that none of their party have changed faith in America. They
were well dressed, spoke English well, and were a creditable looking
set of men.
