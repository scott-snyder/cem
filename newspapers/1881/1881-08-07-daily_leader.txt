Chinese Affairs.

The American consul at Canton, China, Mr. Scrogg, passed through on
No. 4 yesterday, going east on a leave of absence on account of ill
health.  Mr. Scrogg rays that the intelligent Chinese, especially
those of his consulate, Canton, are very much pleased with the new
treaty, especially with those clauses relating to the opium trade,
which was forced upon them at the cannonâ€™s mouth by England, and
continues to be so, by milder means perhaps. Speaking of the recent
removal of the Chinese students from American schools, the gentleman
said that he had not heard of it until his arrival at San
Francisco. The Chinese, however, are a peculiar people, set and
unprogressive, and wish to preserve their institutions. He presumed
that the students were imbibing American ideas too readily, and our
republicanism must be always inconsistent with their monarchist
institutions. The Leader may add, upon the statement of Chaplain
Wells, that at home, Mr. Scrogg says,the Chinese neither get drunk nor
swear, but under the civilizing influence of Americans, they are
readily learning to do both.
