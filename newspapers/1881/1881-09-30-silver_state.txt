The Chinese Educational Commission Home, established in Hartford,
Conn., several years ago, finally closed its doors yesterday. The last
party of students, twenty-seven in number, started for China, in
charge of Commissioner Woo, and one of the teachers, and the
servants. The fine building erected by the Chinese Government two
years ago will be sold. Yung Wing, attached to the Chinese Legation,
remains in this country for the present, but it is expected that he
will return to China next Winter.
