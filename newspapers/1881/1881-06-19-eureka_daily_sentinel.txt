Instructions from China to Establish a Telegraph Department.

NO TELEGRAPH COMMUNICATION IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE.

[Special to the SENTINEL.]

New York, June 18.—The Herald’s Hartford special says: The Chinese
Government recently sent instructions through the Embassy at
Washington to the Chinese Educational Commissioner in this city to
establish a Department of Telegraphy, and operations will be commenced
next week.  At present there is no telegraphic communication in the
Chinese Empire, excepting between a few of the large places on the
coast. It is understood that communication is solely English, or other
tongues than Chinese, and that no system has yet been devised by which
the Chinese can communicate by wire in their own language. The
project, as reported here, contemplates the establishment of a
governmental telegraph system to extend to all parts of the Empire,
with operators who are to be thoroughly instructed alike in the theory
and practical operation of the electric telegraph. It will be
necessary to prepare a system of telegraphic signs and symbols, so
that each shall indicate the Chinese characters. It is proposed to
have the students here, in learning the art, use the ordinary system
of this country, and as they are well acquainted with English they
could in their own country either telegraph in English and translate
in English, or use the proposed system of Chinese telegraphic
symbols. The students selected for the telegraphic class are those
most advanced in their studies in this country, and who are shortly to
return to China. G. B. Hubbell, who has recently resigned the position
of Manager of the Western Union Telegraph Company, has been engaged by
the Commission as instructor.
