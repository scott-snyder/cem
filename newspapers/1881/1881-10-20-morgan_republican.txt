Why the Chinese Students were Called Home.

Master Kin Ta Ting, one of the young Chinamen who had been pursuing
their studies at Exeter, N.H., writes a letter to an eastern paper, in
which he says:

"The Chinese educational mission was established some years ago under
the auspices of that learned Chinaman, Hon. Yung Wing, LL.D., a
graduate of Yale College, and until a year and a half ago the reports
sent home were that the boys were doing well, both in scholarship and
conduct. But when the present Commissioner, Won Kim Shu, came to
America, he began to send back adverse reports. He belongs to the
retired class of Chinamen and looks with disfavor upon American
methods and institutions. All his reports were disparaging. At the
beginning of the present year, the Minister at Washington, Hon. Chan
Lan Pin, was instructed to investigate the matter and report to the
home Government. In his report he says: 'Mr. Woo informs me that
although the boys have not learned all the useful science, they have
adopted all the bad customs of America.'

"From what Mr. Woo says I should judge that the mission will be of
more harm than advantage to the Chinese Government. There is no need
for the boys to stay longer in this country, for they have such a
degree of knowledge that on their return to China they will forget
themselves. I think that the mission be abolished immediately."

We are personally acquainted with Master Kin Ta Ting, and know him to
be a young man of character and ability. He very much regrets that,
due to the unjust and uncalled-for reports of Mr. Woo, he is obliged
to leave his education half complete and return home. Mr. Kin Ta Ting
sails for China the first of next week.  Source:
