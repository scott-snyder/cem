Kin Ta Ting, one of the recalled Chinese students, has written a
letter in which corroborates the story that Minister Chin Lan Pin sent
home an adverse report, founded on Commissioner Woo's statements, and
that the recall was owing wholly to that report. He says: "There can
be no doubt butt that if the Minister at Washington had made a
personal investigation of our standing for scholarship and conduct his
report would have been different."
