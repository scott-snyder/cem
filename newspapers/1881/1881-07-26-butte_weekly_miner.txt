Too Much Learning.

New York.July 16.â€”A Hartford dispatch says the abolition of the
Chinese educational commission and the recall of the students in this
country is a matter which has been under consideration by the present
government of China for many mouths. The step has been taken because
of fear upon the part of the home authorities that the progress made
by students in matters outside of the strictly educational work in the
schools is not to be of advantage to the Chinese future. The young men
who have come here only for the purpose of learning our language, in
order have free advantages in our schools, have gone so much further
in their advances in all directions that it has attracted the serious
attention of the home rulers. The whole tendency of the studies has
been to liberalize the students, which is what the home authorities do
not want, as they see in it grave possible complications in the
future. A large amount of money has been expended since the work
began in 18, & at the present time the expense to China just in taking
care of the students alone, saying nothing of contingent expenses is
over $100,000 a year.
