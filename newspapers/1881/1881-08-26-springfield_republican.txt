The 51 Chinese students who passed through the city this week on their
way from Hartford to San Francisco, being the second installment
ordered home by their government, attracted considerable attention
during the short time they were in town. About all their
fellow-students left here were on hand to see the party off, as well
as many of their white friends.  They say that the third and last
installment of students will start for China in about two weeks. The
party includes Lee Yan Foo, who studied here seven years and was well
known to all recent members of the high school.
