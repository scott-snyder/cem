Chinese Students en Route Home.

Chicago, Aug. 10. Twenty-five Chinese students on their way home from
Hartford, arrived here to-day. They say they have completed the
studies for which they were sent. One reason they give for being
summoned home is that the Government military and naval academies are
closed to them. As Germany allows them to enter her institutions,
China will probably send her students thither hereafter, and to
England. They state that none of their party have changed faith in
America.  They were well dressed, spoke English well, and were a
creditable looking set of men.
