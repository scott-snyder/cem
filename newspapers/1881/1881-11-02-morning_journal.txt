The first important message from the recalled Chinese students is a
letter from Chan Pan Fay, dated Yokohama, September 28.  The party of
which he was a member, set sail from San Francisco September 5, and
most of the voyage was in very rough water. As they left the harbor
all joined in singing Old Hundred, and then gave three times three for
America and San Francisco, where they were very kindly entertained. It
was then, he writes, that they first began to feel that they were
leaving the land of freedom and education behind them.
