The Chinese Government has come to the conclusion that its telegraph
lines might better be under its own management than in the hands of
enterprising foreigners; and the preliminary steps to that end have
been taken in the establishment of a school of telegraphy in Hartford.
The Chinese Embassy at Washington recently received instructions to
form a class of forty from among the Chinese students in Hartford, and
Mr. Yung Wing has just chosen its members and placed them under the
charge of Mr. Hubbell, late manager of the Hartford office of the
Western Union Company. A class-room has been furnished with every
requisit appliance, and Mr. Hubbell expects that within two months the
students under his instruction will be competent to teach others. As
soon as they have attained the requisit proficiency they will be
ordered home, and probably accompanied by a few skilled Americans to
superintend tho construction and operation of new telegraph lines.
