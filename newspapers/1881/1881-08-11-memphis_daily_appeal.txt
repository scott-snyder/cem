Celestials on the Wing.

Chicago, August 10. The Chinese students on
their way from Hartford home arrived to-day. They say they have
completed the studies for which they were sent. One reason they give
for being summoned home is that this Government's, military and naval
academies are closed to them. As Germany allows them to enter her
institutions, China will probably send her students thither hereafter
and to England. They state that none of their party have changed their
faith in America. They were well dressed and spoke English well, and
were a creditable looking set of young men.
