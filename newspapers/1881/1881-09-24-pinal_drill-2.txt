The Educational Mission at Hartford.

The Hartford correspondent of the N. Y. Times, in writing of the
recall of the Chinese students, says: It would be interesting to have
the opinion of Yung Wing upon the defeat of the cherished scheme of
his life; but Yung, although manifestly disappointed, declines to make
any public statement, perhaps regarding it as not in accordance with
official etiquette, and preferring to wait until he reaches Peking
before expressing his views. In private conversation he is reported as
saying that the Imperial Government has had no intention of casting a
stigma upon the American educational system, but has acted upon the
misrepresentations of officers in whose judgment it was bound to
confide.

Trusting to Woo and Chin, the Government could not do otherwise than
order the mission discontinued, and Yung has little expectation that
the enterprise will be renewed. He will return to China and give an
account of his stewardship. While waiting for the arrival of his
successor he has been spending the summer with his Yankee wife and
family in a cottage in Westbrook, on the Sound.

Chaing Tsan Yue, the newly appointed Chinese Minister to the United
States, is expected to arrive in October.  He is represented as a man
about 50 years old, who has had much experience in public affairs and
is a favorite of the Viceroy, Li Hung Chang. He was for ten years
assistant manager of the Shanghai arsenal. He has been in charge of a
customs district, perhaps the most lucrative position of the sort in
the Empire, yielding a legitimate income to the incumbent of about
$200,000 a year. It is probable, therefore, that Chiang ranks among
the millionaires.
