Hartford, Conn., July 16.â€”The abolition of a Chinese educational
mission, and recall of students in this country has been under
consideration by the government of China for many months. The young
men who have come here only for the purpose of learning our language,
in order to have free advantage of our schools, have gone so much
further, and their advances, and all directions have attracted the
serious attention of home rollers. The whole tendency of the
government has been to liberalize the students, which the home
authorities do not want, as they see in it grave possible
complications in the future. A large amount of money has been expanded
since the work began in 1875, and at the present time the expense to
the Chinese government in taking care of students, a loan, saying
nothing of contingent expenses, is over $100,000 per year.
