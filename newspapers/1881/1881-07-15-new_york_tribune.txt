Late advices from China indicate the recall of a Chinese educational
mission established in Hartford in 1872. The cause of this action is
not clearly understood, but it is expected that the boys will soon
start home. There are about 100 now studying in this country, of whom
50 are in college or technical schools. Early termination of the
mission causes much regret here.
