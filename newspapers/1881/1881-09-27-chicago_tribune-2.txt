THE treaties concluded recently between America and China have been
published in the latter country, and are not liked by the Chinese, who
think the restriction on Chinese immigration shows an unfriendly
spirit on the part of tho United States towards their country. The
withdrawal of Chinese students from American colleges is solely
ascribable to the ill-feeling thus created. The American merchants
resident in China are displeased at the provision of the treaty having
reference to the opium traffic.
