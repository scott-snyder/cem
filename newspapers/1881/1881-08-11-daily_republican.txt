The first party of twenty-five Chinese students who left Hartford for
their homes arrived at Chicago yesterday.  They said they had finished
the studies for which they were sent to this country.  One reason
given by them for being summoned home is that the military academies
in this country are closed to them.  As Germany allows them to enter
her institutions, they will probably be sent hereafter to that country
or to England.  Nine of their party have changed their faith (become
Christians) in America.
