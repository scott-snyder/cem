Chinese Students Must Go.

Easton, August 18.â€”Imperative orders from a commissioner of the
Chinese government were received yesterday by three Celestial students
at Lafayette College to report in New York to-day, to be with one
hundred and seventeen other Chinese students taken back to China. All
the students are charged by the commissioner, who is prejudiced
against the American customs, with abandoning their national political
views and religion and becoming Americanized. The young students are
loth to go, but have no alternative. When they arrive in China all
will unite in a statement to the government of the facts in their case
in hopes that the authorities will send them back. A few years ago a
Chinese student at Lafayette was ordered home and was soon after
beheaded for reasons similar to the above.
