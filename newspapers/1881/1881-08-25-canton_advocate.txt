THE CHINESE STUDENTS.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 19. â€”It is announced at the Chinese legation that
next Monday, Yung Wi Chaing, the assistant commissioner of education,
will start for China with another party of Chinese students numbering
forty. It is said also that in September Commissioner Wood will return
with the rest and the establishment at Hartford will be closed up and
deserted.  Yung Wi Chaing says that he thinks his government will
eventually send on another lot of boys to be educated. He denies that
his government is removing the students because they are becoming
Americanized, but he says the boys came here when about 10 years old,
and now have grown up until they range from 21 to 19 years of age, and
it is about time that some use was being made of them. They will all
be put to work on the new telegraph line from Pekin to Tien Tsin. Some
of them, he says, who have been here since they were 10 years old,
have forgotten their own language to such an extent that they can with
difficulty carry on a conversation in it.

He says further that the Chinese government has decided to adopt a
military school system modeled after.  West Point, and it will be
located at Tien Tsin. Our tactics and manual of arms will be adopted.
