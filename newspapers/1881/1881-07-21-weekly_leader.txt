Recall of the Chinese Mission.

Hartford, Conn., July 14. â€” Late advices from China indicate the
recall of the Chinese educational mission, established in Hartford in
1872. The cause of this action is not clearly understood, but it is
expected that the boys will soon start for home. There are now about
100 studying in this country, of whom 50 are in colleges or technical
schools. The early termination of the mission causes much regret here.
