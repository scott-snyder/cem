The Chinese Government established, some years ago, at Hartford, Conn
an educational bureau, where a number of the brightest Chinese youths
were sent to learn the English language. A good deal of money was
spent here, the average annual coat of the institution to China being
$100,000. The Pekin authorities have just issued orders to discontinue
this little arrangement, on the ground that the Chinese students
attending our colleges were learning too much. If they would confine
themselves to learning English so as to be able to act as
interpreters, the Emperor would be very much pleased, but they
discover a great deal more, become decidedly too smart, and acquire a
contempt for the ideas, manners and civilization of "the flowery
kingdom." The Chinese statesmen very sensibly declare that the
government cannot afford to educate young men to look down on and
scorn it.
