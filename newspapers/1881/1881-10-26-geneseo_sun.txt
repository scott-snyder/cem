The Chinese Apt Scholars.

The Hartford Courant says: "Should the Chinese educational mission be
removed, the most lasting impression made by the visitation of the
Chinese scholars here and the tradition that will stay longest after
them will be of their remarkable aptness as scholars, and of the great
successes which they made in our schools."
