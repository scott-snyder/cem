Some of the Chinese students who have been summoned home have been in
this country nine or ten years, and have almost forgotten their native
language. The commissioner who has charge of them says the government
thinks it is time for them to come home and go to work, and that they
will be employed on the new telegraph line between Pekin and
Tien-Tsin.
