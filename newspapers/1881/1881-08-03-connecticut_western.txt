The Chinese Students.

The Cheyenne Leader containing a report of an interview with Tsu Soon
Kee, an attachee of the Chinese Embassy at Washington. He says that
the Chinese students withdrawn from America will be sent to England,
France and Germany. They number one hundred.  The Chinese Government
will hereafter educate students in Europe and also in China, where
military and naval schools are being established. The inference drawn
by the interviewer is that the Chinese Government fears the
progressiveness of American institutions.
