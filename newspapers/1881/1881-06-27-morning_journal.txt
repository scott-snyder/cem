Chinese Youth and Telegraphy.

Four of the twenty-five Chinese students in telegraphy now at Hartford
were students in this city, residing on Greene street. The Chinese
government is waking up to the importance of the telegraph, hence its
command consigning these young men to an acquisition of the
telegraphic art. They are described as remarkably apt students of
telegraphy.  This fall the advanced students to the number of twenty
will probably be sent on to China, and there is some talk that their
instructor, Gershom B. Hubbell, will accompany them.
