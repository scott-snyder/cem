Title: THE CHINESE.

THE CHINESE.

It is reported that instructions have been received from the Chinese
Government modifying the original order for the return of the Chinese
students in this country. It is believed, at any rate, that this order
will ultimately be reconsidered. There is a suspicion that the refusal
of our Government to permit Chinese youths to enter our military
schools in large numbers had something to do with the recent action of
the home Government. Then it is true that the boys showed an
insubordinate disposition, which rather alarmed the Special
Commissioner.
