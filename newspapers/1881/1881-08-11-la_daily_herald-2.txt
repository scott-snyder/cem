Chinese Students en Route Home

Chicago, August 10th.â€” Twenty-five Chinese students on their way from
Hartford home arrived to-day. They say they have completed the studies
for which they were sent. One reason they give for being summoned home
is that the government's military and naval academies are closed to
them. As Germany allows them to enter her institutions, China will
probably send her students thither hereafter and to England.  They
state that none of their party have changed their faith in
America. They spoke English well and were a creditable looking set of
men.
