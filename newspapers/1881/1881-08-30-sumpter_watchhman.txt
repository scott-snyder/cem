The Chinese Government did not order home the students in this country
a day too soon, if we may trust the Hartford Courant. American
schoolboys were in danger of being ruined by Chinese cheap
labor. "When they have entered a school or college, or taken up a
study, they have forthwith proceeded to step to the head of the school
and to master the whole of the study. It has been amazing to see how
in a strange country, speaking a foreign and peculiarly difficult
language, they have managed in so many ways on so many occasions to
beat their American boy associates." Every principle of protection to
home industry required that these boys should be shipped at once, and
it is very fortunate that the Chinese forestalled the high tariff men
in their action.
