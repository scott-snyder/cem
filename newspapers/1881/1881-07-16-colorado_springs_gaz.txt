Recalling Their Students.

HARTFORD, CONN., July 14. â€” Late advices from China indicate the
recall of the Chinese educational mission, established in Hartford, in
1872. The cause of this action is not clearly understood, but it is
expected the boys will soon start for home. There are now about 100
studying in this country, of whom 50 are in colleges or technical
schools. The early termination of the mission causes much regret here.
