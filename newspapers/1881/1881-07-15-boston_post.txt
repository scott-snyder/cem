THE CHINESE MISSION.

HARTFORD, Conn., July 14.

Late advices from China indicate the recall of the Chinese Educational
Mission, established in Hartford in 1872. The cause of this action is
not clearly understood, but it is expected that the boys will soon
sail for home. There are about one hundred of them now studying in
this country, of whom fifty are in colleges or technical schools. The
mission has done important work in educating boys, and its early
termination causes much regret here."
