Concluded to Let 'em Stay.

New York, Aug. 6. The Post's Washington special says: It is reported
that instructions have been received from the Chinese government
modifying the original order for the return of the Chinese students in
this country. It is believed, at any rate, that this order will
ultimately be reconsidered. There is a suspicion that the refusal of
our government to permit Chinese youths to enter our military schools
in large numbers had something to do with the recent action of the
home government.  Then it is true that the boys showed an
insubordinate disposition, which rather alarmed the commission.
