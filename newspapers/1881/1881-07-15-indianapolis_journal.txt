Recall of the Chinese Educational Mission

HARTFORD, CONN., July 14. â€” Late advices from China indicate the
recall of the Chinese educational mission, established in Hartford in
1872. The cause of this action is not clearly understood, but it is
expected that the boys will soon start for home. There are about one
hundred of them now studying in this country, of whom fifty are in
college or technical schools. The early termination of the mission
causes much regret here.
