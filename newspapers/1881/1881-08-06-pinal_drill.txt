TELEGRAPHING.. -The Chinese government has come to the conclusion that
its telegraph lines might better be under its own management than in
the hands of enterprising foreigners; and the preliminary steps to
that end have been taken in the establishment of a school of
telegraphy in Hartford. The Chinese embassy at Washington recently
received instructions to form a class of forty from among the Chinese
students in Hartford, and Mr. Yung Wing has just chosen its members
and placed them under the charge of Mr.  Hubbell, late manager of the
Hartford office of the Western Union company.  A class-room has been
furnished with every requisite appliance and Mr. Hubbell expects that
within two months the students under his instructions will be
competent to teach others. As soon as they have attained the requisite
proficiency they will be ordered home, and probably accompanied by a
few skilled Americans, to superintend the construction and operation
of new telegraph lines.
