Students to be Taught at Home.

Recently arrived Chinese mails contain the Foochow Herald, which gives
an account of a college to be established in Shanghai or Tsentsin, for
the purpose of giving a round technical education to Chinese youths,
without going to the expense of sending them to a foreign country. The
directorship of the college will be given to Monsieur Prosper Giquel,
of Foochow Arsenal, now in Europe. Chinese students who have studied
in America or Europe, and who are found competent, will be offered
professorships.
