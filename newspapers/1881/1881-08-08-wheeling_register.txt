Chinese Students

Washington, Aug. 6â€”It is reported that instructions have been received
from the Chinese government making an original order for the return of
the Chinese students in this country. It is believed at any rate that
this order will immediately be rescinded. There is a suspicion that
the refusal of our government to permit the Chinese youths to enter
the military schools in large numbers had something to do with the
recent action of the home government.  Then it is true that the boys
showed an insubordinate disposition which rather alarmed the special
commissioner.
