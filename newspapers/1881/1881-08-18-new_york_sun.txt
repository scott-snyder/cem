It now appears that the reason given by the Chinese Government for
recalling the Chinese students in this country is that they have
abandoned their national political views and religion and have become
Americanized. If it is true, as is reported, that a Chinese student
was ordered home some years ago, and beheaded for similar reasons, it
is natural that the students here should be rather loath to return to
the Flowery Kingdom.
