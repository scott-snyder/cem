Herald's Hartford special The Chinese government recently sent
instructions through the embassy at Washington to the Chinese
educational commission in this city to establish a department of
telegraphy and operations will be commenced next week. At present
there is no telegraphic communication in the Chinese empire excepting
between a few of the larger places on the coast. It is understood that
communication is solely in English or other tongues than Chinese and
that no system has yet been devised by which they can communicate by
wire in their own language. The project as reported here contemplates
the establishment of a governmental telegraph system to extend to all
of the empire with operators who are to be thoroughly instructed alike
in the theory and practical operation of the electric telegraph. It
will be necessary to prepare a system of telegraphic signs and symbols
which shall indicate Chinese characters. It is proposed to have the
students here in learning the art use the ordinary system of this
country and as they are well acquainted with English they could in
their own country either telegraph in English and translate into
Chinese or use the proposed system of Chinese telegraphic symbols. The
students selected for the telegraphic class are those advanced in
their studies in this country and who are shortly to go to China.
Gresham B Hubbell, who has recently resigned the position of the
Hartford managership of the Western Union Company, has been engaged by
the commission as instructor.
