The first party of Chinese students connected with the educational
commission in this country left Hartford yesterday for China via San
Francisco.  There were about twenty in the party, and they return to
the celestial empire with reluctance. The Chinese government has
likely reached the conclusion that the United States is not a good
place to educate youths who are to become citizens of a monarchy, and
therefore, called these students home. Those who enjoy the freedom of
this country for a few years are not likely to afterwards live
contentedly under government like that of China.
