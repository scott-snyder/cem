Title: THE CHINESE STUDENTS.

THE CHINESE STUDENTS.

It seems that one reason why the Chinese students are being withdrawn
from the United States is because the naval and military schools here
are closed against them. They can go to England or Germany and obtain
entrance to their naval and military schools without any trouble, but
our absurd and antiquated restriction upon foreign-born applicants has
rendered it impossible for them to avail themselves of American
institutions in these respects.  Why our naval and military schools
should be closed against foreigners is one of those things which
nobody can understand. It seems the more ridiculous when we reflect
that there is no such thing as an American race, but that this nation
is the most composite in the world, being made up of every kind and
degree of men. That such a people should exclude all not native-born
from their naval and military schools is, to say the least,
inexplicable.
