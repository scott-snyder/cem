---The young Chinese students who have been recalled by the home
Government and who made a halt in San Francisco on the way, attracted
much attention in that city by the fashionable cut of their clothes
and their general appearance of elegance and refinement.  They
especially provoked the admiration of their compatriots in the Chinese
quarter, who evidently regarded them as the aristocrats of the flowery
kingdom. They were treated with much courtesy wherever they went.
