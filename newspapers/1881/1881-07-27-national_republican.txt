The Chinese and America.

Cheyenne, W. T., July 20.---The Leader to-morrow will contain a report
of an interview with Ten Soon Kee an attache, of the Chinese embassy
at Washington.  He says that the Chinese students withdrawn from
America will be sent to England, France and Germany They number one
hundred. The Chinese government will hereafter educate students in
America and also in China where military and naval schools are being
established. The inference drawn by the interview is that the Chinese
government fears the progressiveness of American institutions. Ten
Soon Kee says the new embassy headed by Jam Tsan Roo will go to
Washington in December.
