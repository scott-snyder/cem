Recall of Chinese Students.—The Chinese government has discontinued
its American educational commission and recalled the students who were
in the schools and colleges of this country.  These were mostly in the
New England States, where the young men learned not only our language
and sciences, but imbibed political ideas which made them radicals
when they returned home, and their government, realizing this, broke
up the whole arrangement. It is believed that Young Wing, who induced
the Chinese government to consent to the foreign education of so many
young men, did s to introduce liberal and progressive ideas into his
own country by this means. The plan cost over §100,000 a year.
