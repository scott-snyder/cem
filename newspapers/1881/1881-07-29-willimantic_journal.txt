Very few journals have an apparent desire to go to the root of the
removal of the Chinese students from this country.  Very few men of
ordinary intelligence can fail to see the reason. It must be known
that these recalled students are not to go back to China, but are to
be distributed through France, England and Germany. Therefore the
action of the Chinese government is not taken through any pigheaded
conservatism about “progress.” The truth is that China is greatly
incensed at the treatment her citizens receive from Americans on the
western slope. While Kearney is politically dead Kearneyism still is
alive. Brutal outrages upon Chinamen are resented at the Chinese
court.  European nations do not permit such suicidal acts even in the
interest of polititions. The United States winks at it and no wonder
China declines to have her brightest young men educated according to
this style of modern civilization. The Chinese must indeed go.
