Official notice has been received from China of the ratification of
the two treaties between that country and this. The treaties were
ratified by the Senate at the last regular session. In this connection
it may be stated that the reason why the Chinese students are to be
withdrawn from American schools is because our ways are "too
progressive." The students will be sent to Europe for education.
