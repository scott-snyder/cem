The Chinese Retrogression.

New York, July 16.â€”A Hartford dispatch says: The abolition of the
Chinese educational commission and recall of the students in this
country is a matter which has been under consideration by the present
government of China for many months. The step has been taken because
of a fear upon the part of the home authorities that the progress made
by the students on matters outside of strictly educational work in the
schools is not to be to the advantage of the Chinese future.  The
young men who have come here only for the purpose of learning our
language, in order to have the free advantage of our schools, have
gone so much farther in their advances in all directions that it has
attracted the serious attention of the home rulers. The whole tendency
of the movement has been to liberalize the students, what the home
authorities do not want, as they see in it grave possible
complications in the future.

A large amount of money has been expended since the work was begun in
1872 and at the present time. The expense to the Chinese government in
taking care of the students alone, saying nothing of contingent
expenses, has been over $100,000 a year.
