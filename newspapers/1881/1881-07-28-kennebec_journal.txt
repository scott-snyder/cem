What Kwong Ki Chin Says.

Hartford, July 27. Kwong Ki Chin, the Chinese educational
commissioner, does not credit the dispatch from Cheyenne, to the
effect that the students re-called by the Chinese government from this
country are to sent to Europe. Officials at the headquarters here have
had no such intentions. They are simply ordered home with the students
under their care.
