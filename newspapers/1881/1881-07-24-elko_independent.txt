A Hartford dispatch says the abolition of the Chinese educational
commission and the recall of the students in this country is a matter
which has been under consideration by the present government of China
for many months.  The step has been taken because of the fear upon the
part of the home authorities that the progress made by students
outside of the strictly educational work in the schools is not to be
of advantage to the Chinese future. The young men who have come here
only for the purpose of learning our language, in order to have free
advantage in our schools, have gone so much further in their advances
in all directions that it has attracted the serious attention of the
home rulers. The whole tendency of the studies has been to liberalize
the students, which is what the home authorities do not want, as they
see in it grave possible complications in the future.
