How the Chinese Students Went Home.

Baltimore, Sept. 1.â€”A special despatch from Washington to the Sun
says: "There has been considerable gossip in diplomatic circles over
the action of the Chinese government in ordering home all the Chinese
students who were at the New England colleges.  It has been said that
the withdrawal of these students was authorized by the Chinese
minister here after a report made by a special commissioner sent by
the Chinese government to investigate the workings of the institutions
where their students were placed, but it is understood that the
special commissioner made only a pretense of investigation, and it is
believed here that the Chinese Government had determined on the
removal of the students before the commissioner was dispatched on his
pretended errand. These young Chinese students, most of whom have
already been started on their way home, have had a very fine time
while in the United States, and have been welcomed into the best
society of the cultured cities of New England, as well as made much of
whenever they had been in Washington. They departed however, with the
most gloomy forebodings, and it is anticipated that there is a good
prospect of having their heads chopped off on their arrival at
home. The Chinese embassy here keeps as dumb as an oyster over the
reasons which have induced the recall of these students and, in the
absence of better information it has been conjectured that it is due
to the ill-treatment which has been visited up to the Chinese
immigrants upon the Pacific coast.  But it is hinted that the real
reason may lie in the fact that the Chinese students, like the
Japanese who have been sent over here to be educated, were rapidly
abandoning and forgetting the customs and traditions of their own
county, and repudiating their own religion without acquiring any
other.
