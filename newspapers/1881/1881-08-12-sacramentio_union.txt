The Returning Chinese Students.

Omaha, August 11th.--Twenty-two Chinese students, who have been
attending various American Colleges, passed through Omaha yesterday,
en route home. As to the causes of their recall, which affects all the
Chinese students in the United States, they had but little to say,
although seeming to know what they were. One of the reasons for this
action by the Chinese Government was the refusal on the part of the
United States Government to admit them to the Naval School at
Annapolis and the West Point Military Academy. The Chinese Government
will hereafter send its students to Germany and England, where the
military schools are not closed against them. There are yet forty
Chinese students at Harvard, twenty-six at Yale and the rest are
divided between Cornell, Lafayette and Columbia, all of whom will soon
start for home.
