News is received from the Chinese legation of a backward step in the
Chinese Empire. The Chinese students in this country are to be
recalled, and the large Chinese Educational Commission located at
Hartford is to be abolished for the reason, it is supposed, that the
Home Government of China fears the liberalizing influence of
civilization. It is believed that the fear that the Chinese students
would, outside of their regular studies, receive views which would not
be of advantage to the Chinese Empire is one of the controlling
reasons for this action. Young Wing, the head of the Educational
Commission, has an American wife, and is very thoroughly American in
his motions. His advanced views, it is feared, are no longer
acceptable to the Home Government.
