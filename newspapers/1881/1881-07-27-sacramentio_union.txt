The Chinese Students.

Cheyenne (Wyo.), July 26th.â€” The Leader to-morrow will contain an
interview with Tsu Soon Kee, an attache of the Chinese Embassy at
Washington. He says that the Chinese students withdrawn from America
will be sent to England, France and Germany. They number 100. The
Chinese Government will hereafter educate its students in Europe and
China, where military and naval schools are being established. The
inference drawn by the interviewer is that the Chinese Government
fears the progressiveness of American institutions. Tsu Soon Kee says
the new Embassy, headed by Jum Tsou Roo, will go to Washington in
December.
