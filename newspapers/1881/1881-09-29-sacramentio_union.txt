Chinese Going Home.

Hartford, September 28th.---The Chinese Educational Commission Home,
established in this city several years ago, finally closed its doors
yesterday. The last party of students, twenty-seven in number, started
for China, in charge of Commissioner Woo. and one of the teachers and
the servants. The fine building erected here by the Chinese Government
two years ago will be sold. Yung Wing, attached to the Chinese
Legation, remains in this country for the present, but it is expected
that he will return to China next winter.
