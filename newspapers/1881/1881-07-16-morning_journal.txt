The Chinese Students.

There is a probability that the promising educational scheme which the
Chinese government has been trying in this country for the past ten
years will speedily come to an end. There is reason to believe that
Chin Lan Pin and Yung Wing, the ambassadors to this country, have been
superseded by a new minister, who is instructed to put a stop to the
educational project, and have all those connected with it students,
instructors and attendants sent back to China. The headquarters of the
commission has always been in Hartford, where it owns a fine building
for residence. There are at least 100 young men in the country, about
50 being in various colleges, while the others are in preparatory
schools. They are picked boys of good families, have exhibited great
aptness for study, and have made themselves favorites every where. The
abandonment of the enterprise, if it is decided upon, will occasion
much regret. It was originated by Yung Wing, himself a graduate of
Yale and one of the most progressive Chinese statesmen of the age.  He
has resided in this country during the past ten years, and, with the
sanction of his government, has adopted the American dress and married
an American wife, an intelligent lady of Avon, in this State. For many
years he has been associated with Chin Lan Pin, in charge of the
Chinese embassy to this country. It is reported that both of these
gentlemen are preparing to return to China, and that the first boys to
be return ed will be those of the recently formed school of
telegraphy.
