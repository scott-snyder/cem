Recall of the Chinese Education Mission

Hartford, July 15â€“Late advices from China indicate the recall of a
Chinese educational mission established in Hartford in 1872. The cause
of this action is not clearly understood, but it is expected that the
boys will soon start home. There are about 100 now studying in this
country, of whom 50 are in college or schools.
