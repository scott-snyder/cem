Hartford, July I5.---It is probable that the promising educational
scheme which the Chinese government has been trying in this country
for the past ten years will come to an end.  It is believed that Chin
Lan Pin and Yung Wing, the Chinese ambassadors to this country, have
been superseded by a new minister, who is instructed to put a stop to
the educational project and have those connected with it, students,
instructors and attendants, sent back to China. The headquarters of
the commission has always been in this city. There are at least 1000
young men in this country, about 500 being in various colleges, while
the others are in preparatory schools. They are boys picked from good
families, have displayed great aptitude for study, and are favorites
everywhere. It was organised by Yung Wing, who is a Yale graduate and
one of the most progressive Chinese statesmen of the age. He has
resided in this country for the past ten years, and with the sanction
of his government adopted American dress and married an American wife,
an intelligent lady of Avon, in this State. For several years he has
been associated with Chin Lan Pin in charge of the embassy to this
country. It is reported that both of these gentlemen are preparing to
return to China, and that the first boys to be returned will be those
of the recently formed school of telegraphy.
