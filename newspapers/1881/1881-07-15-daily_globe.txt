Chinese Educational Mission Terminated

Hartford, July 14â€“Late advices from China indicate the recall of the
Chinese educational mission established in Hartford in 1872. The cause
of this action is not clearly understood, but it is expected that the
boys will soon start for home. There are about 200 now studying in this
country, of whom fifty are in colleges or schools. The early termination of
the mission is causing much regret here.
