Talk With the Chinese Students.

Twenty-five Chinese students, on their way from Hartford to their
homes, arrived in Chicago on Wednesday.  They say that they have
completed the studies for which they were sent.  One reason they give
for being summoned is that this Government's military and naval
academies are closed to them.  As Germany allows them to enter her
institutions, China will probably send her students thither hereafter
or to England.  They state that nine of their party have changed their
faith in America. They were well dressed and spoke English well.
