It will be a general source of regret that the Chinese students who
were sent to this country to be educated have been recalled. It is
stated that a Chinese official of high rank, sent here to make a
secret investigation of their progress, was alarmed to find that they
had cut off their queues, thrown aside their flowing Chinese garments,
and become in short Americanized. As the N. Y. Herald remarks, "the
graduate of a New England College carries under his hat an amount of
political and social dynamite sufficient to revolutionise a
continent," and as China does not wish to be turned upside down, she
has called her young men back to the land of steady habits.
