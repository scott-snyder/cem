A Chinese Withdrawal.

Hartford, Conn., July 14.â€“Late advice from China indicates the recall
of the Chinese educational mission, established in Hartford in
1872. The cause of this action is not clearly understood, but it is
expected that the boys will soon start for home. There are about one
hundred of them now studying in this country, of whom fifty are in
colleges or technical schools. The mission has done an important work
in educating the boys, and its early termination causes much regret
here.
