Why the Heathen are Recalled

Chicago 30.--Boston special: The Journal publishes the reason which
actuated the Chinese government in recalling its young men who are
students at Hartford. It seems the Emperor a year ago dispatched a
mandarin in high rank to Hartford to inquire into the workings of the
educational commission. This individual had never been outside the
limits of his native land and possessed only book knowledge of foreign
countries. On reaching Hartford he was horrified at finding the wards
of his nation had become Americanized to an alarming degree, some
being so far acclimated as to have parted with their pigtails The
shock was too great for the nerves of the conservative functionary.
Yung Wing, the able head of the commission, failed in his efforts to
clear away the prejudices of his visitor who declared the effect of
their sojourn was to alienate the boys from their country and its
customs, to undermine the most sacred traditional principles of
government, and socially to implant and foster seditious ideas which
would become a germ of social if not civil and religious trouble among
their own people; the whole influence and tendency of the mission was
pernicious and dangerous in the extreme. He therefore recommended the
immediate abandonment of the enterprise and the recall of all
students, and this course has been adopted by the home government It
is understood the Chinese government was very largely influenced by
the fact that colleges and scientific schools in America do not
furnish practical industrial instruction and was also misled by its
special envoy declaring that the machinery and manufacturing products
in the great mills of the country were inferior. The students will
therefore be sent to France and Germany. Chinese officials, residents
in this country, are trying to convince their government that the
statements about the inferiority of our machinery and products are
unfounded.
