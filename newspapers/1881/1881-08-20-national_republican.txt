The Chinese Students.

It is announced at the Chinese legation that next Monday Yung Wi
Chaing, the assistant commissioner of education will start for China
with another party of Chinese students numbering forty.  It is said
also that in September Commissioner Woo will return with the rest and
the establishment at Hartford will be closed up and deserted. Yung Wi
Chaing says that he thinks his government will eventually send on
another lot of boys to be educated. He denies that his government is
removing the students because they are becoming Americanized, but he
says that the boys came here when about ten years old and now have
grown up till they all range from twenty-one to nineteen years of age
and it is time that some use was being made of them.  They will all be
put to work on the new telegraph line from Pekin to Tien-Tsin. Some or
them, he says, who have been here since they were ten years old have
forgotten their own language to such an extent that they can with
difficulty carry on a conversation in it. He says further, that the
Chinese government has decided to adopt a military school system
modeled after West Point, and it will be located at Tien-Tsin. Our
tactics and manual of arms will be adopted.
