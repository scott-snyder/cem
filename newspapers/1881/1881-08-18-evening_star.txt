The opinion expressed by The Star the other day to the effect that the
Chinese students at the various institutions of learning in the United
States were called home because they were adopting American ideas and
customs too rapidly, is borne out by reliable information on the
subject lately made public. It seems that the whole matter of
determining what should be done in the premises was left to a special
Commission sent over to this country from China for that express
purpose, and with powers entirely independent of the diplomatic body
regularly accredited to this government, resident in Washington, who
are said to favor the stay of the students here. This special
commission is said to have reported to his government that the
students have adapted American costumes and manners, discarding every
distinctive sign of nationality, hiding their queues, dropping the use
of their native tongue, and failing to observe the customs of the
religion of Confucius.  Therefore, he has ordered the whole company of
120 to return---and there is no appeal. It is understood they will
unite in a prayer to their government, as soon as they reach China, to
allow them to return.
