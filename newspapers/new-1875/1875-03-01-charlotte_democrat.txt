Chinese Students in America.

It used to be said of Connecticut that she furnished schoolmasters and
Congressmen for the rest of the United States. Apparently the past
fame of the Nutmeg State has made its way to China, for there are now
sixty Chinese students at various academies in Connecticut, divided
into six divisions, and all within easy reach of Hartford. Thirty more
have recently arrived at San Francisco, and are on their way to the
same destination. Their expenses are paid by their government, and
care is taken that they shall not lose sight of home ties. A Chinese
school is in constant session at Hartford, and the divisions are
required to repair thither for study in regular succession. This plan
secures two weeks of study in Chinese literature for every two months
of study in the English branches.  The students who are sent to the
United Sates are selected by competitive examination from the
brightest pupils in the home schools. They are chosen indiscriminately
from the rich and poor.
