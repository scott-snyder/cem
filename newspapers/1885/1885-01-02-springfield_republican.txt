A New Haven paper in speaking of the Yale college composition prizes
lately awarded, the first of which was taken by Yan Phou Lee, a
Springfield Chinese student, says that his victory suggests the
excellence in English which has distinguished the Yale men from China
since the time when Yung Wing took several of the earlier prizes and
one of the Townsend medals.
