-Thirty-three Chinese students recently arrived at San Francisco, on
their way to Hartford, Conn. Thirty of them are sent over at the
expense of the Government. Their ages range from ten to fourteen
years. They were chosen from the best classes by competitive
examination. They are to remain in this country fifteen years and to
be thoroughly taught in literature and the sciences. Within the past
three years ninety students have come from the Flowery Kingdom to be
educated, and it is expected that the Chinese Government will annually
send over her young men to be trained in our institutions.
