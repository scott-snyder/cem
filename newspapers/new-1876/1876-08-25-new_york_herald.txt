THE PRESIDENT AT THE EXHIBITION.

PRESIDENT GRANT AND FAMILY AT THE CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION---
NATIVE JERSEYMEN AND GOVERNOR BEDLE.

Philadelphia, August 24, 1870.

President Grant, accompanied by Mrs. Grant, Mr.  and Miss Sharp,
U.S. Grant, Jr., and General Dent, arrived here from Long Branch this
morning, and were received by General Hawley and Director General
Goshorn. The President spent several hours in Machinery Hall, and,
before leaving the grounds, received the Chinese students in the
Judges' Hall.

Governor Bedle, of New Jersey, was formally welcomed on his arrival at
the exhibition by Edward C.  Knight and a reception committee of
native Jerseymen who are now residents of Philadelphia. At noon the
Judges' Hall was crowded with a brilliant assemblage of visitors from
New Jersey, and Hon. Abram Browning was introduced by Governor Bedle
as the orator of the day, who had been appointed under the arrangement
initiated by tho Centennial Commission for periodical addresses by
orators from the different States descriptive of the history and
resources of such States.

Mr. Browning then very ably reviewed the important developments of the
early and recent history of New Jersey, giving full and interesting
statistics, showing the immense progress made by that State in the
last fifty years.

At the conclusion of Mr. Browning's address the visitors, headed by
the First regiment band, proceeded to the New Jersey building, where a
grand reunion was held.

The paid admissions for to-day are estimated at 56,615.
