Thursday was New Jersey's day at the big show. Four thousand Jerseymen
were landed at the Vine street wharf in Philadelphia and visited the
Exhibition, who, with the President's party and the Chinese students
made it a good paying day. The President, the Jerseymen, and the
Chinamen were all delighted with the sights of the Exhibition. The
aggregate of the visiting multitude on that day was estimated at
60,000. The young Chinamen made a very fine appearance.
