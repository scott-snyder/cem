The Centennial Exhibition.

Philadelphia, Aug. 24.â€”President Grant, accompanied by Mrs. Grant,
Mr. and Mrs.  Sharp, U.S. Grant, Jr., and Gen. Dent, arrived from Long
Branch this morning and were received by Gen. Hawley and Director
General Goshorne. The President spent several hours in Machinery Hall,
and before leaving the grounds received the Chinese students in the
judges' hall. Gov. Bedle of New Jersey, was formally welcomed on his
arrival at the exhibition by Edward C. Knight, and a reception was
given him by a committee of native Jerseymen now resident at
Philadelphia.

At noon the judges' hall was crowded with a brilliant assemblage of
visitors from New Jersey, and Hon, Abraham Browning was introduced by
Gov. Bedle as orator of the day, who had been appointed under the
arrangement initiated by the Centennial Commissioners for periodical
addresses by orators from different states, descriptive of the history
and resources of such states. Mr. Browning very ably reviewed the
important developments of the early and recent history of New Jersey,
giving full and interesting statistics, showing the immense progress
made by that state in the last five years. A grand reunion took place
in the New Jersey building.

The paid admissions today are estimated at 56,615.
