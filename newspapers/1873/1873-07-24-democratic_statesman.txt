Des Moines, Iowa. July 22. An extraordinary and daring robbery on a
railroad train was committed last night two and a half miles west of
Adair, on tho Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. At this point
there is a sharp curve in the road, and there the robbers placed heavy
timbers on the track to throw the east bound passenger train off. The
engineer, John Rafferty, saw the obstruction in time to reverse tho
engine and apply the air break, but the robbers observing the
movement, fired at him from an ambush, and shot him dead. The engine
struck the logs and went off the track into a ditch, and was followed
by one of the baggage cars, the others remaining on the track.
Several persons were bruised, hut none seriously hurt.  The robbers,
who were masked, after opening and robbing the safes of the express
messenger of its contents, rode off on horseback. Among the passengers
were thirty Chinese students en route to Springfield, Massachusetts.
