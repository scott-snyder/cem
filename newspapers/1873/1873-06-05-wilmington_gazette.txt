The only Chinese students now being educated abroad under Imperial
sanction are those studying in Massachusetts and Connecticut.  More
are expected in July, and will he placed by Commissioner Laison in
families of respectability and culture, where they will be treated
kindly and so governed as to bring out all the good there is in
them. The Commissioner visits all the boys—who range in age from ten
to sixteen years—once every two months, and if he is not satisfied
with their improvement it is his duly to place them in other
families. They do not enter schools or academies until they have been
in this country about year and half studying in private houses. First
they are taught to read and spell, write and draw; then arithmetic,
grammar, geography, and other branches in the customary American
order.  Those who have been here for some time are docile, and have
made commendable progress.  It is the intention of the Chinese
Government, at whose expense they were sent out, to have them learn
all that can be learned in American schools and colleges, and when
they shall have been graduated from them to have them study various
professions, such as medicine, engineering, law, &c., and finally,
recalling them, to place them in responsible positions under their
home government.
