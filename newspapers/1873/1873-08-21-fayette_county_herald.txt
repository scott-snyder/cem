One incident of the recent railway robbery in Iowa that appears to
have escaped the reporter's pencil heretofore was the conduct of the
Chinese students in the rear car. The sudden stop piled them in an
indiscriminate heap on the floor of their coach, and there they laid
during the meelee, mourning in choice Chinee and swearing in choicer
English. A Californian, one of those untamable wags that no disaster
can disconcert, sagely assured them that there was nothing unusual in
that way of stopping in fact, that all trains east of Omaha would come
to a halt in the same manner. Chang Fy Ong, one of the attendants,
expressed the opinion that it was "one hellee country," and the
Mongolian howl was renewed.
