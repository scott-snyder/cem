CHINESE EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS.

The Chinese Commissioners having the supervision of the education of
the Chinese students in this country arrived at the Sturtevant House
last week, from Hartford, where they have their headquarters. The
party consists of Chin Lan Pin, Secretary of the Board of Punishment;
Yung Wing, second in rank; Chan Laisun, an officer of the fifth rank;
and Yeh Yun Sing and Yang Tsang Chang, Chinese professors. They have
recently visited Hamilton, Yale, and Amherst Colleges and have now gone
to Washington, to witness the opening of Congress. They will visit Key
West and other points in the South on a tour of pleasure. Chan Laisun,
who acts as interpreter for the party, is a graduate of Hamilton
Collage, and speaks the English language very fluently.  He says the
Commissioners have under their charge a number of young men who have
just come from China, and who will soon enter upon a regular course of
college education to prepare themselves for useful professions at
home, When asked how the American system of education compared with
that in China, he replied that the systems of the two countries were
so different that it was impossible to draw a parallel; that education
was as general there as here, though public schools were supported to
small extent, and that these were patronized exclusively by the
separate clans to which they belonged. Their private schools, he
observed, were numerous and extensively patronized, and were generally
in a highly prosperous condition.  It is the intention of the
Commissioners to incorporate in their school systems the best features
of those in this country and to this end they propose visiting various
educational institutions throughout the United States.
