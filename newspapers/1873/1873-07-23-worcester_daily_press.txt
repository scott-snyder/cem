Daring Robbery of a Railroad Train--The Engineer Shot Dead.

Des Moines, Iowa, July 22.â€”An extraordinary and daring robbery of a
railroad train was committed last night four miles west of Adair, on
the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific railroad.

At this point there is a sharp curve, and here the robbers placed
heavy timbers across the track to throw the east bound passenger train
off. The engineer, John Rafferty, saw the obstruction in time to
reverse his engine and apply the brake, but the robbers observing the
movements, fired at him from their ambush and shot him dead.

The engine struck the logs and went off into the ditch, followed by
one of the baggage cars, the others remaining on the track.  Several
passengers were bruised, but none seriously.

The robbers, who were masked, after opening and emptying the safe of
the express messenger of its contents, rode off.  Among the passengers
were thirty Chinese students en route to Springfield, Mass.

A reward of $7,000 has been offered for the apprehension of the
robber.
