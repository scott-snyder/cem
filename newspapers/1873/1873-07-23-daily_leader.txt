IOWA.

Des Moines, Iowa, July 22. -An extraordinary and daring robbery of a
railroad train was committed last night four miles west of Adair, on
the Chicago, Rock Island Pacific railroad. At this point there is a
sharp curve in the road, and here the robbers had placed heavy timbers
across the track to throw the east bound passenger train off the
track.  The engineer, John Rafferty, saw the obstructions in time to
reverse the engine and apply the air brake, but the robbers observing
the movement, fired at him from their ambush and shot him dead. The
engine struck the logs and went off the track into the ditch, and was
followed by one of the baggage cars, the others, with the passenger
cars remained on the track. Several of the passengers were bruised,
but not seriously hurt. The robbers who were masked, after opening and
emptying the safe of the express messenger of its contents, rode off
on horseback. Among the passengers were thirty Chinese students, en
route for Springfield, Mass.
