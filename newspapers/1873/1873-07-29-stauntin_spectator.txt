An extraordinary and daring robbery on a railroad train was committed
on the night of the 21st, four miles west of Adair, on the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific railroad. At this point there is a sharp curve
in the road, and here the robbers placed heavy timbers across the
track to throw the eastern-bound passenger train off. The engineer,
John Rafferty, saw the obstructions in time to reverse the engine and
apply the airbrakes, but the robbers, observing the movement, fired at
him from an ambush, and shot him dead. The engine struck the logs and
went off the track into a ditch, and was followed by one of the
baggage-cars, the others remaining on the track. Several passengers
were bruised, but none seriously hurt. The robbers, who were masked,
after opening and emptying the safe of the Express messenger of its
contents, rode off on horseback. Among the passengers were thirty
Chinese students en route for Springfield, Mass.
