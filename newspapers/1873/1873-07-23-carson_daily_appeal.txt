Des Moines. Iowa. July 22. An extraordinary and daring robbery of a
railroad train was committed last night about four miles west of
Adair, on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. At this point
there is a sharp curve in the road, and here the robbers had placed
heavy timbers across the track to throw the East-bound passenger train
off the track. The engineer saw the obstruction in time to reverse his
engine, and apply the air brakes, but the robbers observing the
movement fired at him from ambush and shot him dead.  The engine
struck the logs and went off the track and was followed into the ditch
by one of the baggage cars, the others, with the passenger cars,
remaining on the track. Several passengers were bruised but not
seriously hurt.  The robbers, who were masked, after opening and
emptying the safe of the express messenger of its contents rode off on
horseback. Among the passengers were thirty Chinese students en route
to Springfield, Mass.
