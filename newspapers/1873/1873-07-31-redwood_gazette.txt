DARING ROBBERY OF A RAILROAD TRAIN. DES MOINES, Iowa, July, 22.â€”An
extraordinary and daring robbery of a railroad train was committed
last night four miles west of Adair on the Chicago, Rock Island
Pacific railroad. At this point there is a sharp curve in the road,
and the robbers had placed heavy timbers across the track to throw the
Eastern bound passenger train off. The engineer, John Rafferty, saw
the obstruction in time to reverse his engine and apply the air brake,
but the robbers, observing the movement, fired at him from ambush and
shot him dead. The engine struck the logs and went off the track into
the ditch, and was followed by one of the baggage cars, the other with
the passengers remaining on the track. Several passengers were bruised
but not seriously hurt. The robbers were masked, after opening and
emptying the safe of the express messenger of tho contents, rode off
on horseback. Among the passengers were thirty Chinese students
enroute to Springfield. Mass.

Governor Carpenter issued a proclamation to day offering a reward of
$5,000 for the arrest of each of the persons engaged in the robbery.
