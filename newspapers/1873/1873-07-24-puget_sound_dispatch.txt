DES MOINES. Iowa, July 22.â€”An extraordinarily daring robbery of
railroad train was committed last. night on the Chicago. Rock Island &
Pacific R. R. at this point. There is a sharp curve in road, where the
robbers had placed heavy timbers across the track. Engineer John
Rafferty saw the obstruction in time to reverse the engine and apply
the air brake. but the robbers saw the movement and fired at him from
ambush and shot him dead. The engine struck the logs and went off the
track, followed into the ditch by one of the baggage cars, the others,
with the passenger cars, remaining on the truck. Several passengers
were bruised. but not seriously hurt. The robbers. who were masked,
rifled the safe of the express messenger and rode off on
horseback. Among the passengers were 30 Chinese students.  en route
for Springfield. Mass.
