CHINESE STUDENTS.

By the Colorado yesterday there came about two dozen young Chinamen,
in charge of a tutor. They "put up" at the Occidental Hotel and are en
route to Springfield, Mass., where they will enter school. There was
something in the dress and general appearance of the young men which
secured immunity from attacks by stone and club throwers. I was much
amused the other night to see Dr. O’Donnell, the great pill-roller and
Chinese “argitator,” addressing a mass meeting in front of the Bella
Union theater, inveighing in bitter terms against all who in any way
patronize Chinese tradesmen or manufacturers, and at the same time the
fellow had about twenty Chinese lanterns hung up around him to "throw
light on his subject.” Consistency, thou art a jewel The Chinese
seemed to have gone mad yesterday.  There were several extensive and
bloody rows in their quarter, in which knives, pistols and swords were
used freely. Two of the creatures got into a quarrel about something
when one, with a razor, inflicted a nameless mutilation upon his
adversary who will probably die from the effects of the
wounds. Altogether, they are a nice element in our social system.  The
present week will be prolific of murder trials and horse races. On
Saturday a trotting race for ten thousand dollars— best three in
five—at Agricultural Park, near Cliff House.
