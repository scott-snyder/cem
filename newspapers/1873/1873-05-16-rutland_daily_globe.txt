Title: Chinese Students.

Chinese Students.

The movement of Chinese and Japanese towards America is very
Interesting. Asia began by furnishing a western stream of emigration,
which in the course of many thousand years reached America. Now Asia
comes to America by sailing eastward, to learn what of arts and
sciences the emigrants have picked up in their travels.

Another party of Chinese students is to arrive in Springfield in
July. The almond eyes of these people are not set just in our style,
but they look pretty straight into things, nevertheless. The students
are to be placed to board with people of culture, who live in good
style, are willing to care for the boys as for their own children, and
will look well after their manners, morals and personal
appearance. During the first eighteen months they are to receive
instruction from some member of the family, after which they will
enter public schools or academies.

Several of the oblique eyed boys have been attracting attention in
Hartford with their queues, little hats, thick soled shoes, queer
coats and pants, and their parchment colored faces. They are located
at several points along the Connecticut river in Massachusetts and
Connecticut. Their ages are ten to sixteen, and the course of study is
to occupy fifteen years. Some may get through sooner. The government
of China educates them, and will give them important positions. They
are to study law, medicine and engineering upon their return to
China. They will exert an immense influence in directing the destinies
of the Chinese Empire, and the coming generation will probably witness
the inauguration of a revolution in that Empire in favor of Western
Ideas.
