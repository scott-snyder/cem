SPRINGFIELD AND VICINITY

The 30 Chinese students lately arrived at San Francisco, and the
fourth and last installment of the 120 picked youths of the nation to
be quartered in New England for education in American ways, have
reached this city, and will be distributed to their new homes. Like
their fellows, they are to be allowed 15 years of study, when they are
expected to demonstrate the advantage of American culture and methods
to the satisfaction of the eastern government. They are in charge of
Ngan Ngoh-liang, who has been appointed commissioner of Chinese
education in the United States, succeeding Chin Lan-pin, appointed
ambassador to Peru.  Kwang Ki-chin, an author of Chinese and English
dictionaries, who was in this country, last year, but has not an
American education, succeeds Chan Laisun as secretary of the
commission.
