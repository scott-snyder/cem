CHINESE STUDENTS.

There are now sixty Chinese students supported by their Government in
Connecticut and Massachusetts. Thirty came two years ago and thirty
arrived a year since, and thirty more are expected in about a
fortnight.  So far their deportment has been excellent, and their
progress quite remarkable.  The students are placed at first in
cultured families, two in a place, where their first aim is the
mastery of our language. They are all under strict supervision, and
spend each from two to four weeks a year at the "Headquarters" of the
Chinese Educational Commission, in Hartford, where they are carefully
examined as to their habits and progress. The Boston Traveller says
that, scattered in some twenty or thirty different towns, these boys
have everywhere been favorites. The kindness with which they have been
treated has been very gratifying to the commissioner here and to the
Chinese Government at home.
