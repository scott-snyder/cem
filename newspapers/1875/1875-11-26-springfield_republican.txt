A fresh party of 30 Chinese boys arrived in San Francisco, on
Saturday, to be educated in this country, and will start their week,
for this city and Hartford. Ngan Ngoh Ling is the commissioner and has
charge of the students. Kwang Ki Chin is the official translator and
joint commissioner. The latter brings his wife, and the former his
wife and daughter.


Yung Wing has bought a $10,000 lot, near the residence of the late
Bishop McFarland at Hartford, on behalf of the Chinese Educational
Commission, which intends to erect on it a large building, capable of
accommodating 70 persons, to be used as the headquarters of the
commission, so that large numbers of lads can be under its
supervision.
