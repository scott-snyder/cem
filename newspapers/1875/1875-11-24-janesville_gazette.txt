CHINESE LADS IN NEW ENGLAND.

Why They Came Over, and How They are Taken Care Of.
New York Herald, Sunday.

The Yale Alumni Association held its second monthly social reunion of
the winter series at Delmonico's, Fourteenth street and Fifth avenue,
last evening, there being about 125 members present. In the absence of
the President, William M. Evarts, the chair was taken by the
Rev. Dr. Adams, vice-president. After a brief discussion of business
matters, Rev. Joseph H. Twichell ('59) was introduced to the
gathering, who made the address of the evening. His subject was "The
Career of Yung Wing," the only Chinese graduate of Yale College, and
in fact, the only graduate of any college from the Celestial Empire in
this country. Yung Wing was of the class of '54, and is the originator
and curator of the Chinese Educational Mission in the United States.

Immediately after leaving Yale he returned to his native land, with a
view of bringing to a successful end the idea of educating in this
country a number of Chinese boys. After a struggle of the most heroic
nature, Yung Wing is now enjoying the fruits of his efforts, as there
are already in charge of the mission, which is located at Hartford,
ninety lads from that land and thirty more are in California on their
way there.

For the education of these boys, the Chinese Government has
appropriated $1,500,000, which is expended by the officials as
circumstances demand. The boys come here from the ages of ten up to
fifteen and remain about fifteen years, growing to manhood under the
influences of American education and principles.
