The Chinese Educational Commission

The chief of the Chinese educational commissioners in this city, the
assistant commissioners, and the superintendent in charge of a large
number of Chinese students at Springfield, Mass., arrived here this
morning, and will spend several days visiting public institutions.
The visit is made especially for the benefit of the chief
commissioner, who will soon return to China, where he holds high rank.
