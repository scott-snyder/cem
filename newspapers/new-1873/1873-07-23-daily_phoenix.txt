Des Moines, Iowa, July 22. An extraordinary and daring robbery on a
railroad train was committed last night, four miles West of Adair, on
the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. At this point there is
a sharp curve in the road, and here the robbers placed heavy timbers
across the track to throw the East bound passenger train off. Tho
engineer, John Rafferty, saw tho obstruction in time to reverse the
engine, and apply the air brakes, but the robbers, observing his
movement, fired at him from their ambush and shot him dead.  The
engine struck the logs and went off the track into the ditch, and was
followed by one of the baggage cars; tho others remaining on tho
track. Several passengers were bruised, but none seriously hurt. The
robbers, who were masked, after opening and emptying the safe of the
express messenger of its contents, rode off on horseback. Among the
passengers were thirty Chinese students en route to Springfield, Mass.
