Railroad Train Robbed and Engineer Murdered

Dis Moines, Iowa, July 22.â€” An extraordinary and daring robbery of a
railroad train was committed last night within four miles of Adair, on
the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. At this point there is
a sharp curve in the road, and here the robbers had placed heavy
timbers across the track to throw the East bound passenger train off
the track.  The engineer, John Rafferty, saw the obstruction in time
to reverse his engine and apply the air brakes, but the robbers,
observing the movement, fired at him from ambush, and shot him
dead. The engine struck the logs and went off the track, and was
followed into the ditch by one of the baggage cars, the others with
the passenger cars remaining on the track.  Several of tho passengers
were bruised but not seriously hurt. The robbers, who were masked,
after emptying the safe of the express messenger, rode off on
horseback. Among the passengers were thirty Chinese students en route
to Springfield, Mass.
