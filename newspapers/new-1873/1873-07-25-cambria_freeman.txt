An extraordinary and daring robbery of a railroad train committed
to-day night last, four miles west of Adair, Iowa, on the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific Railroad.. At this point there is a sharp
curve in the road, and here the robbers placed heavy timbers across
the track to throw the east bound passenger train off. The engineer,
John Rafferty, saw the obstruction in time to reverse the engine and
apply the air brake, but the robbers observing the movement fired at
him from ambush and shot him dead.  The engine struck the logs, and
went off the tracks in a ditch, and was followed by the two baggage
cars, the others remaining on the track. Several passengers were
bruised but none seriously hurt.  The robbers, who were masked, took
about $2000 from the express safe, and cut the mail sacks, but took no
letters; moving off across the prairie in a southerly direction, the
whole being done in about ten minutes. Among the passengers were
thirty Chinese students en route to Springfield, Massachusetts.
