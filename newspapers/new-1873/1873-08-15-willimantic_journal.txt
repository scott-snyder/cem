—Two of the Chinese students, Chin Kin Sang, aged 14, and Luk Sik
Quai, age 13, who recently came to this country to be educated, were
in town Monday, with their preceptress, Miss N. J. Post of Hebron, and
were objects of much curiosity. They are bright, keen, active boys,
and learn readily. They eat no meat, butter, bread, milk, &c., but
subsist chiefly on rice and fish. No change in their costume is
permitted by the authorities, except in shoes and hats. We think there
is room for improvement in the balance of their wearing apparel,
especially the pants. We understand the youths are very susceptible to
the tender passion, having already fallen deeply in love with two
Hebron Misses, to whom they offer to give their “back hair,” with the
declaration, “me likee you! you likee me?”
