â€”An auction sale of the furniture of the house in which the Chinese
students lived, in Hartford, disappointed those who went expecting to
buy real Oriental curiosities and ornaments, and proved that the
Chinamen had readily adapted themselves to the domestic habits of the
new world. Nearly everything in the building was of American design
and manufacture. The only foreign articles were a quantity of garments
which had been sent over for the boys to wear, but the youngsters had
preferred the fashions of Hartford.
