A lady in Hartford, Connecticut, has received letters from two young
Chinamen who were formerly students in that city. They say the
anti-Chinese law has weakened China's confidence in this country so
greatly that no more boys will be sent here for education. Those who
have already received a training in our schools are being put into
government positions, displacing foreigners, who have been receiving
very high salaries. Gen. Gordon gets what is equivalent to $100,000 a
year as an instructor and practical head of the army.
