A more lucid and truthful classification of party and sectional
standing on the Chinese question would be this, that those who know
something about them from experience are opposed to the immigration,
while those whose knowledge is supplied from theory and second hand
information or the observations of the few Chinese students in eastern
institutions of learning, favor unrestricted immigration.  Pacific
coast Republicans are as much opposed to this influx as Democrats,
while the only Democrat in Massachusetts went as far as any Republican
in opposition to the measure that was adopted.
