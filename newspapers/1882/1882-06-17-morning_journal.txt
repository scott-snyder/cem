Chinese Students Coming Back.

A dispatch from Denver, Colorado, says Chang Tsung Liang, attache of
the Chinese legation, passed through that place Thursday on his way to
Washington. He said that China will return 50 students to American
colleges, the authorities (thanks, no doubt.  to Yung Wing's presence
in China) having discovered that their removal was a mistake.
