One of the Chinese student formerly at Hartford was understood to have
been deeply enamored of a girl whom he met in society there, and to
have had some expectation of winning her. But he writes back from
China that he is involuntarily a husband. He found, on returning home,
that his parents had chosen a wife for him. "I tried to break it off,"
he says, but without success, as the Chinese consider an engagement of
marriage the most sacred contract. If it is once made, it can never be
broken. According to the Chinese custom the younger brother cannot
marry before an older one. I have two younger brothers who have to
wait for me to before they can. Therefore I was urged very strongly by
my relatives to marry right away, so I consented. Of course it is not
a love affair, but I shall try to do my duty."
