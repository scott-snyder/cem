The Returned Chinese Students.

Tong Ho and Kwong, Chinese students, who lived in Northampton, Mass.,
for some time, and who were lately recalled home, write that the
reports concerning the imprisonment of the recalled students are
true. The boys are placed in confinement at Shanghai, and so
ill-treated as to excite the indignation of resident foreigners and
missionaries. The primary cause of this treatment was the false
reports of the Chinese officials in this country, which were
aggravated by the avarice of subordinate officers in Shanghai, who
sought their own personal gain at the boysâ€™ expense, and in one case
ran off with their money. The boys are home-sick for America. Their
relatives taunt them with being "foreign devils." One of them writes:
I wish I could return to dear, philanthropic New England, where
teachers are better than mothers, where friends are better than
sisters, and classmates more agreeable than brothers."
