It has been stated that the Chinese students, who were called home
from this country a few months ago, were subjected to great
indignities on their return, but a letter recently received at
Hartford from one of the boys who were at school in that city, shows
quite to the contrary. They seem to have been treated with the utmost
courtesy, and whatever prejudice may have existed against them had
altogether disappeared.
