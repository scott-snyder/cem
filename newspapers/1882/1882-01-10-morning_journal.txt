The Course of True Love.

The story has been printed, having for its moral the old adage, "the
course of true love," viz., that Chow Chow Kan, a Chinese student
recently sent from here to China, and at one time in Hopkins' Grammar
school, had his head chopped off at Hong Kong by the government for
the crime of wishing to marry a New Haven young lady of Kensington
street, named Sherman. Dr. S. Wells Williams, Professor of Chinese
Literature at Yale and for 40 years a resident of China, said
yesterday that the whole story seemed apocryphal. The beheading
couldn't certainly have happened in Hong Kong for that was an English
province and not under Chinese law. The locality being incorrectly
given the whole story fails. It was probably invented this side of San
Francisco. A short time ago it was said that one of the same students
had been beheaded for murdering his father. That appeared reasonable.
