China and the Chinese from a Chinese standpoint

At the Park church, Norwich, Sunday evening, Rev. Dr. Bacon, the
pastor, made some interesting observations upon the civilization and
history of China, the first appearance of Chinamen in this country,
and the organization of the Chinese educational commission whose
labors were recently brought to such an abrupt close.

He then introduced his adopted brother Mr. Yew Fun Tan, now studying
for the ministry at Yale, who in an easy, familiar and interesting way
told the congregation more particularly the inside history of the
educational work of the Chinese commission, something of his own
impressions and experiences, and of the mistaken ideas that are
entertained in this country about the students and the Chinese
government. He expressed a slight hope that the students might be sent
back here to resume their studies, but even were they not, he felt
sure that they would not altogether lapse into the ways of their
fellow countrymen at home, but use may of the excellent ideas they had
acquired in New England for the advancement of their own people. Mr
Tan also spoke of the light in which foreign traders and missionaries
are looked upon in China by the natives, and of his own Sunday school
work among the Chinese laundrymen of New Haven. Yew Fun Tan was for
some time an inmate of the family of the late Rev. Dr. Leonard Bacon,
and is stopping Norwich with Rev. Dr. L. W. Bacon.
