One of the Chinese lads, who was recently recalled home, has written a
letter to friends in Colchester. He represents the treatment of some
of the students on their return, as inexcusably harsh. It would seem
that the people of the older nation in their heathenism, have not
learned that the people of the younger nation, though called
Christian, are an intelligent, high-minded and friendly people, whose
good will it is desirable to cultivate, and whose arts of civilized
life it would be useful to imitate. On the contrary they suspect and
regard as enemies of their country, the young men who have by
residence among foreigners, been exposed to their contaminating
influence. The same letter says that the influence of many English
residents in China is hostile to the American Chinese students, the
Englishmen not relishing the idea that Chinese lads should be sent to
America instead of Great Britain for an education. It is a
satisfaction to know that the young man who was reported to have lost
his head because of an attachment to a New Haven girl, was alive and
well at Christmas, and was learning telegraphy. Others of the boys
were assigned to the naval, torpedo, mining and custom house service,
and some to the study of medicine.
