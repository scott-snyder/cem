A Chinese student whose name is a regular series of Chins with an
occasional "a" thrown in by way of variety, fell in love with an
American girl while attending college at Harvard. He was recalled to
China and was lately beheaded because he persisted in remaining true
to his lady love. Having lost his heart he thought it as well to let
his head go too.
