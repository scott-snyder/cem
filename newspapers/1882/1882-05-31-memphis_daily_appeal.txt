Hong Kong, May 2. Commodore Schufeldt, now in Shanghai, reports that
he will soon undertake a new expedition to Corea.

Yung Wing, of New Haven, has been received by Li Hung Chang, who
listened attentively to appeals for the return of the Chinese students
to school in America.  Yung Wing is now en route to Peking to continue
his application. He hopes that thirty or forty may be allowed to
return and resume their studies.
