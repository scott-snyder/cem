The committee appointed to investigate official shortcomings of Hon. B
G. Northrop, secretary of the state board of education, submitted
their report last Wednesday, in which they find him guilty of
"defalcation" in overdrawing the amount allowed him for traveling
expenses, the unauthorized employment of members of his family in
clerical assistance at 40 cents an hour, several trips to Europe, the
Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, attendance upon an
alleged educational society in Washington, and the representation of
Connecticut in the Congressional lobby. He has received over $500 a
year for lectures outside the state, to the neglect of his duties
within the state, and reciprocated by hiring lecturers from other
states, with public money; interrupted the exercises of the state
normal school by drafting teachers therefrom to give illustrations of
"vocal gymnastics" at his lectures; established an office at his house
and was not in his regular office one sixth of the time; has occupied
official time in attending to Japanese and Chinese students, receiving
money and presents for such attention, and has assumed to lecture on
village improvement and tree planting as his duty to the practical
interests of "education."  The committee recommend the abolition of
the office of secretary of state board of education and the salary of
$3,000 a year and traveling expenses $500. This means that the Hon. B
G. Northrop, secretary of the state board of education, must go.
