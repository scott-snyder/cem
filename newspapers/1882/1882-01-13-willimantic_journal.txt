Among the Chinese students who came to this country to obtain an
education were two bright brothers named Chin Chin Yateh and Chin Chin
Chan. They were stationed at New Haven and entered the Hopkins grammar
school, where they made good progress in preparation for Yale
college. When the students in this country were recalled by the orders
of the Chinese government, last May, the two brothers left for
Hartford, where they learned the telegraph business, and later on
returned to China. During their residence in New Haven, Chan became
interested in a young lady named Sherman, and his attentions were
continued, and were only interrupted by his departure. The
acquaintance was kept alive, however, and Chan has corresponded with
the lady ever since. The principal reason for recalling the Chinese
students was the fear, on the part of the authorities that they were
becoming thoroughly Americanized and that they would marry American
wives. Advices received in New Haven, stated that Chan’s persistence
in his devotion to Miss Sherman coming to the knowledge of the Chinese
authorities, the young man was condemned to death, and, according to
Chinese customs, was beheaded in Hong Kong.

There is in New Haven, a young Chinese student who refused to obey the
order to return to China; He is an inmate of the family of the late
Dr. Bacon, and having been converted to Christianity was informed by
Yung Wing, the Chinese commissioner of education, that his life would
be in peril if he returned. He is to study for the ministry. One of
the late Dr. Bacon’s last labors was in arranging for the young man’s
education.
