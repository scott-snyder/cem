Letters received in Hartford from the Chinese students recently
ordered home say that on arriving in Shanghai they were sent to
confinement in a remote part of the town, the Government's intention
apparently being to examine them as to their belief or disbelief of
Christianity before they had a chance to scatter through the
country. None of them had been much inclined to the Christian
religion.
