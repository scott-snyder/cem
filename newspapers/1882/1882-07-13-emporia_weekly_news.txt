One of the Chinese students recalled from this country by the Chinese
government, who, at the time of his recall, was a Sophomore in Yale
college, has written to a Connecticut friend an account of his present
life in China. He denies the rumors of barbarous treatment, and then
says: "The numerous stories afloat may be reduced to this---after the
fanciful parts have evaporated---that we were shut up for weeks in a
rotten place at Shanghai, for fear of our running back to America;
that for the same reason they would not let us go home without
bailsmen; that the majority were sent up to Tientsin; that those at
Tientsin, after a farcical examination, were assigned indiscriminately
to the different schools and factories, and that in these schools we
have been strictly kept, and advantage has been taken of our ignorance
of Chinese laws and customs. We have thus passed a most dry and dreary
winter on this most level of plains. We have not ceased to be homesick
and to pine for America. We have been disappointed a number of times
in our hopes of seeing our parents. It is doubtful whether we can go
this spring. I feel that I am only wasting my life on this desert. I
learn nothing here but what I have learned before. I see nothing here
worth seeing; I experience nothing but homesickness and solitude."
