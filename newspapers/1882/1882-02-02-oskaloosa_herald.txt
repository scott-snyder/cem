The furniture and a few miscellaneous articles left behind by the
Chinese Educational Mission were sold at auction on last Tuesday, in
the mission building at Hartford, for $1,625. The Chinese iron-wood
parlor set brought $300, one purchaser securing nearly all the
pieces. The prices were satisfactory, and a large number of curious
persons attended this rather melancholy end of the Hartford
establishment.
