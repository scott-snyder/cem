Sixteen of the Chinese students who returned from America were sent to
the naval school at the Foo Choo Arsenal.  Their examinations, upon
their arrival from this country, were satisfactory.  Ten new students
have been sent from China to Europe under an appropriation of
$100,000. They will be in charge of the Chinese Minister at Berlin.
