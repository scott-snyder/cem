He Loved, not Wisely, but Too Well

NEW HAVEN. January 8th â€”Among the Chinese students who came to this
country to obtain an education were two bright boys named Chin Chin
Yatch and Chin Chin Chan, who came to this city. They were brothers,
and entered the Hopkins Grammar School, where they made good progress
in preparations for Yale College. While in this city they boarded in
the family of Mr.  Vester, 19 Kensington street.  When the students in
the country were recalled by the orders of the Chinese Government,
last May, the two brothers left for Hartford, where they learned the
telegraph business, and later on returned to China.  During their
residence in Kensington street, Chan became interested in a young lady
named Sherman, living near by. This fancy was strongly opposed on the
part of Miss Sherman's friends, but Chan's attentions were continued,
and were only interrupted by the departure of the young Celestials.
The acquaintance was kept alive, however, and Chan has corresponded
with the lady ever since. The principal reason for recalling the
Chinese students was the fear on the part of the authorities that they
were becoming thoroughly Americanized, and that they would marry
American wives. They were here at Government expense, the object being
to have them return to their native country with power to introduce
American civilization. Advices received here state that Chan's
persistence in his devotion to Miss Sherman coming to the knowledge of
the Chinese authorities, the young man was condemned to death, and
according to Chinese customs was beheaded in Hongkong.
