Yung Kwai, a Chinese student who graduated from the Springfield,
Mass., High School, and who subsequently entered Harvard, was ordered
home by his parents because he had embraced the Christian religion. He
went as far as Hartford in company with some other Chinese students,
but with a companion made his escape from the depot there. He does not
intend to go back to China, and Secretary Evarts says that he cannot
be forced to go. The young man will be taken care of by American
friends, and his expenses will be paid until be completes his
collegiate course.
