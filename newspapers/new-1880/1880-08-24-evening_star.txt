A NUMBER OF CHINESE STUDENTS now in the United States will soon be
sent back to China on account of offenses which they have committed.
Among them is T. C. Chung, an excellent young man, who was graduated
in the class of 1879 at the Norwich (Conn.) Free Academy, and who is
dishonored for having cut off his queue. Woo, the new commissioner at
Hartford, is very strict, and is conducting the Chinese schools under
the rigid discipline of the empire.
