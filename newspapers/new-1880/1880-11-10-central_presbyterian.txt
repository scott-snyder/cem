China is coming along. The government has decided to construct a
system of telegraphic communication between Pekin and Shanghae. The
bringing of China into full and free intercourse with other nations
will be as great an event as the settlement of America by Europeans.
It is a world in itself. It is not generally known that the tendency
of modern ethnological research is to recognize a very intimate ethnic
connection between the Mongol (Turanian) family and the Aryan (India,
Persia, and Europe) family. Both seem to be Japhetic.

China now possesses nearly thirty war vessels, built after European
models, and commanded by officers trained abroad.  They have also
discarded their ancient weapons, and have cannon of the most approved
type, some of them manufactured abroad, some cast in their own
arsenals at home. Five steamers now navigate their rivers and coasts
in place of their old junks.

Their custom-house is managed by European and American
officers. Chinese students are at college in various parts of Europe
and America. A Chinese steamer has made the voyage from that country
to San Francisco.

The missionaries now preach the gospel in many Chinese towns without
molestation, and considerable impression has been made on the public
mind.
