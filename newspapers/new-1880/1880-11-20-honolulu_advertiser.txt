There are now, according to the Japanese newspaper called the Weekly
Mail, 70 Japanese students in the United States, ten of whom are sent
at Government expense; and there are one hundred and eight Chinese
students in the States, sent by the Chinese Government. Some of the
Japanese have graduated at the Boston Law school, Cambridge Law
school, and the Columbia school of Law, and of Mines. The Chinese and
Japanese are preparing to fortify their "new move" in commerce and
politics, by a cultivation of the intellect of their youth according
to western standards. Hawaii has 3 youths abroad who we hope will give
a good account of themselves as students.
