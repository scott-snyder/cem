New York, August 23.â€” The Post this morning says a number of Chinese
students, now in the United Stales, will soon be sent back to China on
account of offenses which they have committed. Among them is T. C.
Chung, an excellent young man, who was graduated in the class of '79,
at the Norwich, Conn., free academy, and who is disgraced for Having
cut off his queue. Woo, the new Chinese commissioner at Hartford, is
very strict and is conducting the Chinese schools under the rigid
discipline of the empire.
