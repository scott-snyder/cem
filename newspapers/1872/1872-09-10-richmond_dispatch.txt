Chinamen Coming to be Educated. Following the example set by the
Japanese, the Chinese Government has sent forty students to the United
States. These young men, who are of the Mandarin class are to receive
a collegiate education in this country, in a course that shall embrace
a knowledge of our language and practical arts and science. The
intention at first was to send these students to England, but the
advice and influence of George F. Steward, United States Consul
General, caused them to be sent to our country. The students will
arrive on the steamer now due at San Francisco.
