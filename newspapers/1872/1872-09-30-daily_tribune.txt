 The thirty Chinese students who arrived yesterday are very young. They
are fine intelligent ladies and gentlemen and have much fairer complexion
than any of their countrymen who have heretofore visited the United
States. Three tutors of the Mandarin rank accompany them. The Chinese
government appropriated $1,000,000 for their education.
