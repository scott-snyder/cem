â€”The Chinese students who arrived at San Francisco on Friday, thirty
in number, are very young. They are fine, intelligent ladies and
gentlemen, and of much fairer complexion than any of their countrymen
who have heretofore visited the United States.  Three tutors of
Mandarin rank accompany them. The Chinese Government has appropriated
$1,000,000 for their education. The design of the Chinese Government
is to send thirty students to this country annually. The ladies of
rank and the boy students, are receiving much attention.  As the last
students, while in America, became contaminated by Christianity, all
the forms of the religion of Confucius will be rigidly enforced, and
the four books of the five Kings, and the sacred edicts of the Emperor
Kangha will be portions of their regular lessons.
