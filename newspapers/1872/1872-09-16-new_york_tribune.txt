CHINESE STUDENTS IN AMERICA—-RELIGIOUS PRECAUTIONS,

San Francisco, Sept. 13.—The thirty Chinese students who arrived
yesterday are very young. They are fine intelligent ladies and
gentlemen, and of much fairer complexion than any of their countrymen
who have heretofore visited the United States, Three tutors of the
Mandarin rank accompany them, The Chinese Government appropriated
$1,000,000 for their education.  The design of the Chinese Government
is to send thirty students to this country annually, The Chinese
ladies of rank who came here to be educated, and the boy students, are
receiving much attention. As the last students, while in America,
became "contaminated" by Christianity, all forms of the religion of
Confucius will be rigidly enforced, and the four books of the five
kings, and the sacred edict of Emperor Kanghi, will be portions of
their regular lessons.
