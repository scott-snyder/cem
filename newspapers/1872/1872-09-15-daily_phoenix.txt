The thirty Chinese students who arrived, yesterday, are very
young. They are fine intelligent ladies and gentlemen, and of much
fairer complexion than any of their countrymen who have heretofore
visited the United States. Three tutors and a Mandarin of rank
accompany them. The Chinese Government has appropriated $1,000,000 for
their education. The design of the Chinese Government is to send
thirty students to this country annually.
