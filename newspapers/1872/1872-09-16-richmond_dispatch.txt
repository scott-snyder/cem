Arrival of Chinese Students.

San- Francisco, September 14.--Thirty Chinese students arrived here
yesterday.  They are very young, and are fine and intelligent ladies
and gentlemen. They are of a much fairer complexion than any of their
countrymen who have hitherto visited the United States. Three tutors
of the Mandarin rank accompany them. The Chinese Government has
appropriated $1,000,000 for their education. The design of tho Chinese
Government is to send thirty students to this country annually.
