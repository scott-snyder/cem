Following the example of the Japanese, the Chinese Government has sent
forty students to the United States, who are to receive a collegiate
education, in a course that shall embrace a knowledge of our language
and practical arts and science, after which they may be able to give
some instruction "in the ways that are dark and tricks that are vain"
of the heathen Chinese.
