How Lazy Chinese Students Are Punished.

A young John Chinaman at Phillips Academy in Andover finds his head in
danger. John had been rather backward in his studies, so that the
faculty considered it their duty to make the same known to the Chinese
Government, at whose expense the young man is educated. This they did,
and one may imagine the disgust that was manifested upon reading the
reply, which was as follows: "Send him home and we will behead him."
John will stay with the Melican man and keep his head. ---Boston
