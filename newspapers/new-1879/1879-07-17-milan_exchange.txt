Two students at williston seminary, who are very fond of wearing showy
clothes, recently took pains to get two suits of the same material,
which they were sure could not be duplicated. Unfortunately, however,
they left some pieces with a local tailor, in whose shop they were
seen by a couple of Chinese students, who procured suits exactly like
them, and the four appeared in the chapel on the same morning with
suits of the same cut and material. The chagrin of the two swells may
be imagined.
