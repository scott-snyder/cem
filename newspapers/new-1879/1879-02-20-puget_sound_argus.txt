CHINESE IMMIGRATION.

On Saturday last the bill restricting Chinese immigration to the
United States was warmly discussed in the Senate, and passed by a vote
of 39 to 27. It was ably opposed by Senators Hamlin and Morrill of
Maine, Matthews of Ohio, Dawes of Massachusetts, and Conkling of New
York, while its principal supporters were Booth of California,
Mitchell of Oregon, Thurman and others.

About all that the new bill does is to prohibit any vessel from
bringing more than fifteen Chinamen to our shores at a time. We do not
anticipate that it will change matters materially, as there will be
plenty of ways to evade such a law and yet carry on the importation of
Celestials to an unlimited extent. They can be brought to British
Columbia and transferred to American shores in small squads, or they
can be taken to New Mexico and cross the line upon the mainland. Once
within United States boundaries they will be free.

There are strong grounds for argument on both sides of this
question. While we readily concede that the Chinaman is a detriment to
America in many respects, there are many things to he said in his
favor which are not as a rule thought of by those whose bitter
opposition to him amounts almost to persecution.  For instance, they
are denounced as being idle, criminal, incapable of civilization,
&c. Prejudice, however, must give way before barren facts.  Official
statements prove that the 60,000, Chinese now in California contribute
over $15,000,000 annually to the revenue of the State. Among the items
in Brooks’ statement to the joint committee of the Senate and House
are: $1,800,000 paid by Chinese as duties; freight and passage money
paid to and from China---$600,000; rents, &c.---$1,000,000; licenses
and taxes---$2,250,000; paid for American products---$5,000,000; paid
for water for Chinese miners—— $2,200,000; mining claims bought by
Chinese---$1,350,000. We may add that it is the opinion of a former
Surveyor General of the State that the Chinese have increased the
value of property in California to the amount of $290,000,000, and
this property is held today by white men. Without their aid the Union
Pacific railroad could not have been built. They have reclaimed
1,000,000 acres of California marsh lands, raising its value per acre
from $3 to $100. By these great works they have furnished employment
to 500,000 white men—— a majority of whom are now trying to drive
their benefactors from the country.

The Chinese have also taught us lessons of industry and economy which
we may heed without detriment. They are reliable in business.  On page
797 of the report of the special committee on Chinese immigration, of
which the late Senator Morton was chairman, is the statement of the
cashier of the Anglo-California bank to the effect that the average
business done with the Chinese is $1,500,000 a year, and that they are
"always straight forward."  On page 853 Mr. McCondray, of San
Francisco, testified that his firm had dealings with Chinese merchants
to the extent of $600,000 a year, and that in 26 years they had not
lost a dollar by them.

How about the criminal and pauper plea? On page 402 of said report are
these statistics: In 1876 there were in San Quentin prison 1,158
prisoners, of whom there were 615 native Americans, 344 Europeans, and
199 Chinese. In the hospital, in the same year, were 2,431 patients,
as follows: Born in Ireland: 1308; native Americans, 1,112; born in
China, 11. In the alms-house at the same time were 240 inmates, as
follows: American born, 143; born in Ireland, 197; Chinese,
NONE. Official figures prove that there are more Europeans engaged in
selling liquors on the Pacific Coast than there are Chinese selling
Opium, and more money is lost and won by white gamblers in San
Francisco, every single day in the year, than by all the Chinese in
America. More than 200 Chinese students are now attending American
colleges; over 3,000 attend Sabbath School in San Francisco, 1,000
have accepted Christianity and 300 have been baptized.  It is needless
to enlarge upon the above showing. We are not here to Champion the
Chinese, but to do them simple justice. The facts we present are a few
of those brought out by recent investigation of the question. There
are now in the neighborhood of a hundred and fifty thousand Chinese on
the Pacific coast alone, and the number is annually increasing. We may
check their flux, but those ARE with us have a iright to live and be
protected instead of being hooted at and hunted down as they
occasionally are by roughs and hoodlums.
