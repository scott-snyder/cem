The heathen Chinee takes kindly to the American Summer resort. Several
of the Chinese students at various institutions in this country are at
Niantic, Connecticut, and may be seen promenading the streets every
fair day with the prettiest girls in town.

Here's hope for some of the bare legged laundrymen who air their shins
on Carson street, to the disgust of ladies who have occasion to pass
up and down of an evening. Go east, John; Niantic is the spot for you;
alle same white man at Niantic.
