the colleges and polytechnic schools of New England and the Middle

industrious and persistent. Five of them have gone into the Yale
Academic Freshman Class; three of them into the Sheffield Scientific
School; two have entered Columbia' one has gone to Amherst; one to the
Boston School of Technology, and one to Troy Polytechnic School.
