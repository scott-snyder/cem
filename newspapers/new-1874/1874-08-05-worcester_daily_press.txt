The third body of Chinese students will shortly arrive from China and
will be located in Springfield until arrangements can be completed for
their disposal among private families in this state and Connecticut.
Mr. Lairum, the Chinese commissioner at Springfield, is much pleased
with the progress the students have made, and considers the project of
educating Chinese youth in this country a success.
