--Two Chinese students were admitted recently to the Yale College
Scientific Department. They passed the examination most creditably,
and gave promise of superior scholarship. There are now sixty Chinese
students supported by their Government in Connecticut and
Massachusetts. Thirty came two years ago, thirty arrived a year since,
and thirty more are soon expected. So far their deportment has been
excellent and their progress quite remarkable. The students are placed
at first in families, two in a place, where their first aim is the
mastery of our language. They are all under strict supervision, and
spend each from two to four weeks a year at the "headquarters" of the
Chinese Educational Commission in Hartford, where they are carefully
examined as to their habits and progress. Scattered in some twenty or
thirty different towns, these boys have everywhere been favorites.
The kindness with which they have been treated has been very
gratifying to the commission and to the Chinese Government at home.
