San Francisco, July 31.â€”It is reported on reliable authority that the
Chinese Government will soon establish a Consulate in this city, and
that the six Chinese companies will defray the expenses of the
establishment for the benefit of the Home Government. It is thought an
American will be appointed Consul, with a Chinese Vice Consul to aid
him. The Chinese Commissioner, who went East recently to make
arrangements with Eastern colleges for the reception of fifty Chinese
students, is clothed with authority to make arrangements for
establishing a Consulate.
