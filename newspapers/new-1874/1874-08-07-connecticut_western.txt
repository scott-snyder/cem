Chinese Students.---The third body of Chinese students will shortly
arrive here from China, and will be sent out among Christian families
in this state and Massachusetts, as their predecessors have been, for
homes, while they are being educated here. Mr. Laisun, the Chinese
commissioner in Springfield, is very much pleased with the progress
which the students studying in this country have made since their
arrival. Two of them will go to college this fall, and several more
will be prepared for the same purpose next year. He considers the
experiment of educating Chinese youth in the United States a
success. On the arrival of tho students here from San Francisco, as
they will come by that route, they will have rooms at the Haynes
House, Springfield, as has been the case in the two previous arrivals,
and will remain there until homes have been provided for them.  Those
families which now have Chinese students in them, and have done well
with them, will be urged to receive more from the new comers, while
some of them will have to go into new families entirely.  Hartford
Post.
