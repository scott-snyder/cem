Two Chinese students were admitted Tuesday to the Yale College
Scientific Department. They passed the examination most creditably and
give promise of superior scholarship. There are now sixty Chinese
students supported by their government in Connecticut and
Massachusetts. Thirty came two years ago thirty arrived a year since
and thirty more are expected in about a fortnight. So far their
deportment has been excellent and their progress quite remarkable.
The students are placed at first in families two in a place where
their first aim is the mastery of our language. They are all under
strict supervision and spend each from two to four weeks a year at the
"Headquarters" of the Chinese Educational Commission in Hartford where
they are carefully examined as to their habits and progress. Scattered
in some twenty or thirty different towns these boys have everywhere
been favorites.  the kindness with which they have been treated has
been very gratifying to the commission here and to the Chinese
Government at home.
