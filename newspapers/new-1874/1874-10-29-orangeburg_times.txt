Chinese Students.

Two Chinese students were admitted Tuesday to the Yale college
scientific department. They passed the examination most credibly, and
gave promise of superior scholarship. There are now sixty Chinese
students supported by their government in Connecticut and
Massachusetts. Thirty came two years ago, thirty arrived a year since,
and thirty more are expected in about a fortnight. So far their
deportment has boon excellent and their progress quite remarkable. The
students are placed at first in families, two in a place, where their
first aim is tho mastery of our language. They are all under strict
supervision, and spend each from two to four weeks a year at the
"headquarters" of the Chinese educational commission in Hartford where
they are carefully examined as to their habits and progress. Scattered
in some twenty or thirty different towns, these boys have everywhere
been favorites. The kindness with which they have been treated has
been gratifying to the commission here and to the Chinese government
at home.---Boston Traveler.
