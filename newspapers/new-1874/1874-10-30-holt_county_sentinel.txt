CHINESE STUDENTS.

Two Chinese students wore admitted on Tuesday to the Yale College
Scientific Department. They passed the examination most creditably,
and give promise of superior scholarship. There are now sixty Chinese
students supported by their government in Connecticut and
Massachusetts, Thirty came two years ago and thirty arrived a year
since, and thirty more are expected in about a fortnight.  So far
their deportment has been excellent and their progress quite
remarkable.  The students are placed at first in cultured families,
two in a place where their first aim is the mastery of our
language. They are all under strict supervision, and spend each from
two to four weeks a year at the "headquarters" of the Chinese
educational commission, in Hartford, where they are carefully examined
as to their habits and progress. Scattered in some twenty or thirty
different towns, these boys have everywhere been favorites. The
kindness with which they have treated has been very gratifying to the
commission here and to the Chinese government at home.---Boston
