Chinese Students. —Two Chinese students were admitted Tuesday to Yale
College, Scientific department. They passed the examination most
creditably, and give promise of superior scholarship. There are now
sixty Chinese students supported by their government in Connecticut and
Massachusetts.  Thirty came two years ago, and thirty arrived a year
since, and thirty more are expected in about a fortnight. So far their
deportment has been excellent and their progress quite remarkable.
The students are placed at first in cultured families, two in a place,
where their first aim is the mastery of our language. They are all
under strict supervision, and spend each from two to four weeks a year
at the "Headquarters" of the Chinese Educational Commission, in
Hartford, where they are carefully examined as to their habits and
progress. Scattered in some twenty or thirty different towns, these
boys have everywhere been favorites.  The kindness with which they
have been treated has been very gratifying to the commission here and
to the Chinese Government at home. —Boston Traveller.
