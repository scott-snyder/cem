More Chinese Students.--Information has been received here that
another delegation of Chinese students, thirty in number, will arrive
early next month. They will be distributed among several educational
institutions in New England. After a short time the Chinese Government
will send another delegation of youths to this country to receive
instruction. This is in accordance with the plan resolved upon by that
Government some years since, and it already has a number of young
Chinamen at school in New England, and it is reported that their
progress is remarkable. As soon as they are thoroughly grounded in
English they are all to return home and take service under their own
Government. Washington telegram in Baltimore Sun.
