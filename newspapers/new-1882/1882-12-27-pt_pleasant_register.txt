Accepting a Wife.

The following is an extract from a letter received by a Hartford lady
from one of the Chinese students who was educated in that city:

"I went home to see my relations the last of March. When I first
reached home you can imagine how glad my father and relatives were to
see me looking so well and robust.  They all flocked around me and
asked me many questions. My little nephew, sent by his mother, came
behind me and pulled my cue to see if it were real or false. I am
going to tell you something which will surprise you.  When I first
landed in Shanghai, my father wrote to me that while I was away a
great many of his friends had offered their daughters to be engaged to
me, and that he had at last, without consulting me, selected one for
me from a mandarin. You know that it is a custom here for the parents
to contract marriages without consulting tho wishes of those who are
to be united. On hearing my engagement I tried to break it off, but
without success, as the Chinese consider an engagement of marriage the
most sacred contract. If it is once made it can never be broken.
According to the Chinese custom the younger brother cannot marry
before the elder one. I have two younger brothers who have to wait for
me to marry before they can. Therefore, I was urged very strongly by
my relatives to marry right away. I did not like to displease my
father by opposing his wishes, so I consented to be united on the last
of April. Of course it is not a love affair, but I shall try to do my
duty. A month after my marriage I come back here to resume my
studies."
