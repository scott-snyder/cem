A Hartford woman has received letters from two young Chinamen who were
formerly students in that city.  They say that the anti-Chinese law
has weakened China's confidence in this country so greatly that no
more boys will be sent here for education.  Those who have already
received a training in our schools are being put into Government
positions, displacing foreigners, who have been receiving very high
salaries. Gen. Gordon gets what is equivalent to $100,000 a year as
instructor and practical head of the army.
