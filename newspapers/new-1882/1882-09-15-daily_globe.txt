A Hartford woman has received letters from two young Chinamen who were
formerly students in the city. They say that the anti-Chinese law has
weakened Chinese confidence in this country so greatly that no more
boys will be sent here for education. Those who have already received
a training in our schools are being put into government positions,
displacing foreigners who have been receiving high salaries.
Gen. Gordon gets what is equivalent to $100,000 a year as instructor
and practical head of the army.
