Getting Too Much Americanized — The Chinese Students.

The impression as to why the Chinese students were recalled is
confirmed by the Shanghai correspondent of the London Times, who says:
"It appears the Chinese government got alarmed at reports which said
that the young men were getting Americanized a little too rapidly, and
sent out a special commissioner, Woo Chiachen, to examine into the
matter. Woo's report, which was indorsed by the resident Chinese
minister, Chen Lanpen, declared that ‘although the boys have not yet
learned all the useful arts and sciences, they have already adopted
all the bad customs,' and concluded that if they stayed longer they
would be of more harm than advantage to the Chinese government, Acting
on this information, the recall was decided upon. So far as can be
gathered from the American papers, the charge is quite unfounded. The
conduct of the young men seems to have been entirely satisfactory to
their masters and friends, and the sudden interruption to their
studies is deplored, not only for their own sakes, but in the best interests
of their country."
