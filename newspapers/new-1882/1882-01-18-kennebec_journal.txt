Two Chinese students who lived in Northampton, Mass., for some time,
and who were lately recalled home, write that the reports concerning
the imprisonment of the recalled students are true. The boys are
placed in confinement at Shanghai and so ill-treated as to excite the
indignation of resident foreigners and missionaries. The primary cause
of this treatment was the false reports of the Chinese officials in
this country, which were aggravated by the avarice of subordinate
officers in Shanghai, who sought their own personal gain at the boys'
expense, and in one case ran off with their money. The boys are
homesick for America. Their relatives taunt them with being "foreign
devils." One of them writes: "I wish I could return to dear,
philanthropic New England, where teachers are better than mothers,
where friends are better than sisters, and classmates more agreeable
than brothers."
