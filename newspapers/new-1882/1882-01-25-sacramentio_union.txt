The Returned Chinese Students.

Chicago, January 24thâ€” The Times' Hartford special says: There have
been conflicting reports regarding the treatment of the Chinese
students, who were ordered home several months ago. A letter just
received from one of the brightest of the boys, who was in the
headquarters of Hartford, says that upon reaching Shanghai the
students were treated very coolly, placed in a damp, dirty
school-house, the doors to which were nailed up, with the exception of
the front entrance, which was guarded by soldiers. Even those who had
homes were not permitted to go outside. There they stayed two weeks,
when by the intercession of influential friends they were permitted to
live elsewhere. They are divided into three sections, ten remaining at
Shanghai, twenty-seven going to Tientsin, and eleven to Foo Chow.  The
writer of the letter is one of the Tientsin company, who are engaged
in different studies. He says the the school-house they occupy is
surrounded by a high mud wall and several canals. The boys are not
allowed to go outside the wall or even visit their friends in another
school, which is in the same inclosure. The whole situation is
decidedly prison-like. There was some expectation at the time the
letter was written that more freedom would soon be permitted.
