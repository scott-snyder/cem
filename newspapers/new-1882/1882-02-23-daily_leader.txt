Letters received at Hartford, Conn., from China since the arrival home
of the Chinese students, say that the first party of forty had been
ordered to Tientsin for telegraph work while the other, who reached
Shanghai early in October, were at once confined in an old building in
a remote part of the town, the governmentâ€™s intention being
apparently"to examine them before they had a chance to scatter to
their homes.
