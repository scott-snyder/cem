The Chinese.

AN INTERESTING LETTER FROM COMMODORE SHUFELDT.

San Francisco, March 21.---The Bulletin publishes an interesting
letter from Commodore R. V. Shuleldt to Hon. A. A. Sargent, giving the
result of his observations on China. He sums up that there is no use
to attempt to put diplomatic intercourse with China on the high moral
ground or to appeal to any of the motives which ordinarily govern
nations. Ineradicable hate of foreigners exists; sympathy will be
construed as weakness. If justice is done China, it must be for its
own sake, without hope of appreciation. If exacted, it must be
unrelentingly. A show of force is the only argument appreciated. China
is especially antagonistic to our form of government. This is
exemplified in the treatment of the returned Chinese students.
