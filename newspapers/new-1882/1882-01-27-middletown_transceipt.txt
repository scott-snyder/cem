A New Cure for Student Love.

—Many anxious parents who have sons at college are of the opinion that
the worst thing that can happen to a student in a college town is to
fall in love.  They are not much out of the way either.  As only about
one young woman in twenty will make a good wife, and as most students
fall in love with whatever girls they are unfortunate enough to meet,
the probability of a family obtaining a desirable daughter-in-law
through the unassisted efforts of a son at college is painfully
small—just about as large, in fact, as that of persuading the ill
-assorted couple to break the match.  The Chinese, however, have
devised a plan that effectually prevents the marriage of students to
the damsels to whom they have made love when they should have been
studying.  One of the Chinese students at New Haven had a tender
passion for a Connecticut maiden. His government ended the affair by
calling the young man home and cutting off his head.  If China will do
as much for American boys within her own dominions she has only to
announce the fact and American colleges, students and all, will be
sent over there by the shipload.---N. Y. Herald.
