The Chinese Students.

Here is another story about the Chinese students who were called home
from the United States because they were having too good a time here:
There have been conflicting reports regarding the treatment of the
Chinese students who were ordered back to China several months ago
since their arrival home. A letter just received from one of the
brightest of the boys, who was in the head-quarters at Hartford, says
that upon arriving at Shanghai the students were all treated very
coolly, and they were all placed in a damp, dirty school-house, the
doors to which were nailed up with the exception of a front door,
which was guarded by soldiers. Even those who had home were not
permitted to go outside. There they staid for two weeks, when, by the
intercession of influential friends, they were permitted to live
elsewhere. They were divided into three divisions, 10 remaining at
Shanghai, 27 going to Tientsin, and 11 to Foochow. The writer of the
letter is one of the Tientsin company, the members of which are
engaged in different studies. He says the school they occupy is
surrounded by a high mud wall and several canals; that the boys are
not allowed to go outside the wall, or even to visit friends in
another school which is in the same inclosure; that the whole
situation is decidedly prison-like. There was some expectation at the
time the letter was written that more freedom would be permitted.
