COMING BACK.

It is stated that the Chinese Government has decided to send back
about fifty of the students who were so suddenly recalled from
American educational institutions last year. The brother to the Sun
and Moon and his advisers have probably discovered that Yale and
Harvard professors do not seek to inculcate a hatred of Confucius and
Mencius, and that their teachings are not dangerous to the Celestial
dynasty or to Chinese civilization. Nevertheless, the lot of these
students is not a happy one, for they will learn enough of our
civilization to render them ever after dissatisfied with that of their
own country, and yet when they return to China every indication of
such discontent will be regarded with jealous anger, and may lead to
their disgrace. The theory of their education here is that they are to
convey what they have acquired to their countrymen, but as a matter of
fact there is very little probability that they will be permitted,
much less called upon, to do any thing of the kind.
