Kissing is unknown in China; consequently, when the two hundred
Chinese students who have been pursuing their studies at Hartford and
New Haven, returned to their native country recently, they did not
know how to greet their mothers and sisters. The lads had learned the
art of kissing in the land of wooden nutmegs and cheap clocks, and
while they yearned to do so, they nevertheless dared not kiss their
female relatives and pretty lady friends. It is certain they have been
taught to kiss by the Connecticut girls. It is said that the moon-eyed
"mashers" are coming back again, and it may be that they will take a
few more lessons from females who are not particular what they kiss so
long as it is some kind of a man.
