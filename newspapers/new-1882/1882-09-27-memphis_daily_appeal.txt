A lady in Hartford, Conn., has received letters from two young
Chinamen who were formerly students in that city. They say the
anti-Chinese law has weakened China's confidence in this country so
greatly that no more boys will be sent here for education.  At a
conference of Chinese merchants held in London recently, at which,
besides those from that city, there were present delegates from
Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Birmingham, and Chinese from
California, New York and Bombay. A series of resolutions were
passed. One of these expressed regret at the action of the governments
of the United States and of Queensland with respect to Chinese
immigration. The Chinese are evidently worked up to a high pitch of
wrath over our anti-Chinese-law, but it will not have been in vain if
it compel them to surrender their exclusiveness and take part in the
affairs of what is now to them the outside world.
