A Tragic Tale. Among the Chinese youth who were sent to this country a
few years ago to be educated were two bright boys named Chin Chin
Yateh and Chin Chin Chan, who came to New Haven, Conn. They were
brothers and entered the Hopkins grammar school, where they made good
progress in preparation for Yale college. While there they boarded on
Kensington street. When the students in this country were recalled by
the orders of the Chinese government last May, the two brothers left
for Hartford, where they learned the telegraph business, and later on
returned to China. During their residence on Kensington street Chan
became interested in a young lady named Sherman, living near by.  This
fancy was strongly opposed on the part of Miss Sherman's friends, but
Chan's attentions were continued, and were only interrupted by the
departure of the young celestial.  The acquaintance was kept alive,
however, and Chan kept up a correspondence with the lady. Tho
principal reason for recalling the Chinese students was the fear on
tho part of the authorities that they were becoming thoroughly
Americanized, and that they would marry American wives. They were here
at government expense, the object being to have them return to their
native country with power to introduce American civilization. News now
comes from China that Chan's persistent devotion to Miss Sherman,
after his return to the flowery kingdom, coming to the knowledge of the
Chinese government, the young man was condemned to death and beheaded
in Hong Kong.
