When the Chinese students got back from Hartford to the flowery
kingdom they were not exactly received with bands of music and
torchlight processions. One of them writing to a friend on this side
says: The first two weeks we had a pretty tough time of it. The
officials thought we all had our cues cut off and had Yankee wives,
and all sorts of nonsense; in fact, they thought we were perfect
barbarians.
