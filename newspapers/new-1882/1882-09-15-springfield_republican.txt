A Hartford Woman has just received letter from two young Chinamen, who
were formerly students in that city. Both letters complain of the
unfairness of the Chinese bill recently passed by Congress, and say
that the bill has so weakened China’s confidence in this country that
it is doubtful whether the students will ever be allowed to
return. One of them says that though the boasted freedom of the United
States is not what it might be, China itself is the home of
tyrants. He then goes on: “We have just been released from that prison
house which is termed the Imperial telegraph college.  More freedom is
thus allowed but often we receive many dire threats of punishment if
we dare to displease them. Several of the boys, owing to the heavy
punishment with which they have been inflicted, nave fled from the
country, two being at present in the Sandwich islands and one in
America. I am now studying testing with a Dane. There are eight of us,
and each shall at the end of the year take general charge of a
station. Each station at present is under the charge of a Dane; but on
the coming first of the tenth moon, that is about November, they will
be discharged, and we are the ones to fill the positions. All
foreigners that are employed by tbe government receive very high
salaries. Gen.  Gordon alone receives 5000 taels per month, which is
equivalent to $100,000 per year.”
