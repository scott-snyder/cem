The Chinese Students.

A Hong Kong dispatch, dated May 2, says Yung Wing, of Hartford, "has
been received by Li Hung Chang, who listened attentively to his
appeals for the return of the Chinese students to schools in
Connecticut. Yung Wing is now on his way to Peking, where he will
pursue his application. He hopes that thirty or forty will be allowed
to return and resume their studies."
