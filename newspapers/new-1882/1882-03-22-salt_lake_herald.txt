SHUFELDT SHOOTS

A Letter Against the Chinese

San Francisco, March 21. The Bulletin publishes an interesting letter
from Commodore R. W. Shufeldt to the Hon. A. A. Sargent, giving the
result of his observations on China. He sums up that there is no use
to attempt to put diplomatic intercourse with China on high moral
ground or to appeal to any of the motives which ordinarily govern
nations. Ineradicable hatred of foreigners exists, and sympathy will
be construed as weakness. If justice is done China it must be for it
own sake, without any hope of appreciation. If exacted it must be
unrelentingly. A show of force is the only argument appreciated by
China, especially if antagonistic to our form of government. This was
exemplified in the treatment of the returned Chinese students. It
holds that, notwithstanding the possession of some formidable ships
and improved weapons, China owing mainly to the character of the
people and gross abuse and corruption pervading all official circles,
has no real aggressive military or naval strength; that there is and
can be no affinity between the people of the United States and China;
that the government of the United States, as well as the governments
of Europe, should insist upon its right in China, conceding no more
than is granted, and trusting no more than it is trusted; that there
never can be any intimate political or commercial relations made to
exist such as the United States may demand. The letter concludes: I
address this letter to you because I remember that you were an earnest
opponent of unlimited Chinese immigration into the United States, both
as a senator and a citizen of your State, although at the time I did
not fully concur with you.
