Recent advices from the Chinese students are very gratifying to their
friends in this city. They are very sanguine that at least fifty will
be sent back to America to complete their English course. The students
of telegraphy are very much appreciated, but their bright hopes lie

examination, and has since been promoted in the department of
telegraphy. ---Norwich Bulletin.
