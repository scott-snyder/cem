News has been received at the state department from the American
legation at Pekin, that the Chinese government has decided to send
back to the United States fifty of the one hundred Chinese students
recently recalled, and it is expected that they will return to
Hartford and complete their studies there. It is believed that the
misrepresentations regarding the training of the boys have been
corrected, and that the government is liberal enough to acknowledge
and correct its hasty action. The Hartford Courant hopes that the news
of the illiberal and unjust Chinese bill now before Congress will not
prevent the Chinese government from carrying out its intention, and
says that Commissioner Yung Wing has probably arrived at Pekin by this
time, and is sufficiently familiar with American politics to explain
to his government that the act is only designed to influence
California elections. and that the American people will be heartily
ashamed of it and repeal it in five years, even if it should escape a
Presidential veto.
