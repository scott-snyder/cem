The Chinese.  A lady in Hartford, Connecticut, has recently received
letters from two young Chinamen who were formerly students in that
city. They say the anti-Chinese law has weakened China's confidence in
this country so greatly that no more boys will be sent here for
education. Those who have already received a training in our schools
are being put into government positions, displacing foreigners, who
have been receiving very high salaries. Gen.  Gordon gets what is
equivalent to $100,000 as an instructor and practical head of the
army.
