One of the Chinese students, formerly at Hartford, was understood to
have been deeply enamored of a girl whom he met in society there, and
to have had some expectation of winning her. But he writes back from
China that he is involuntarily a husband. He found on returning home
that his parents had chosen a wife for him.  “I tried to break it
off,” he says, “but without success, as the Chinese consider an
engagement of marriage the most sacred contract. If it is once made it
can never be broken. According to the Chinese custom the younger
brother can not marry before an elder one. I have two younger brothers
who have to wait for me to marry before they can. Therefore I was
urged very strongly by my relatives to marry right away, so I
consented. Of course it is not a love affair, but I shall try to do my
duty.”
