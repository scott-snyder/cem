New York, August 23---The Post this morning says: A number of Chinese
students now in the United States will soon be sent back to China on
account of offenses which they have committed.  T. C. Chung, an
excellent young man, who was graduated in the class of 1879 at
Norwich, Conn., Free Academy, is dishonored for having cut off his
queue. Woo, the new Commissioner at Hartford, is very strict, and is
conducting Chinese schools under the rigid discipline of the Empire.
