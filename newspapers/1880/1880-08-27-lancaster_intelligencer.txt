A number of the Chinese students now in the United States will soon be
sent back to China on account of offenses which they have
committed. Among them is J. C.  Chung, an excellent young man, who was
graduated in the class of 1879 at the Norwich (Conn.) free academy,
and who is dishonored by having cut off his queue.  Wool, the new
commissioner at Hartford, is very strict, and is conducting the
Chinese schools under the rigid discipline of the empire.
