Yung Kwai, the Chinese lad who graduated from the Springfield (Mass.)
High school last June, with the salutatory, has since got into a good
deal of trouble, which will doubtless attract wide and interested
attention, because his case may possibly affect the policy of his
Government regarding Chinese students in this country. While in
Springfield Yung Kwai became a Christian, and wrote home to his
father, who is one of the highest of the Chinese nobles, though not of
royal blood. The father wrote a very indignant letter to the boy, who
was transferred to Hartford after graduation, and ordered him to
return home at once, threatening to starve and beat him into
renouncing his nonsense. As the boy was determined to be true to his
new faith at all hazards, he looked upon his return to China as going
to almost certain death; but he started quietly with other boys
Saturday for Boston, whence they were to sail for home by way of
Europe.  But Yung Kwai stepped from the train in Springfield on the
plea of bidding good-bye to his friends, and that is the last that has
been seen of him. Where he is nobody seems to know. He is twenty years
old, and he is evidently hoping to keep hidden for a year, until he
becomes of age, and can become a citizen of the United States.  He has
lived in Springfield six or seven years, and was much loved for his
personal virtues, and admired for his intellectual gifts, being
considered one of the most industrious and talented of all the Chinese
students in the care of the commission.  This and his high birth would
doubtless have opened for him a way to special advancement in the
public life of his native country.---Boston Transcript.
