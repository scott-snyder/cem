â€”Dr Bancroft, the principal of Phillips Academy, at Andover, Mass.,
has written a letter in regard to the Chinese students there, in which
he says the results, so far as I may be allowed to speak of them, are
just what might be expected. The students are models of industry,
zeal, politeness and order. They are willing to pay the price of
scholarship, and they get it. In obedience to authority, reverence for
superiors, gentleness of manners, and a certain reticence and
diplomatic turn of mind, they are characteristically Chinese.
Appropriating our learning, they do not renounce their own. Seeking
knowledge in all directions, the truths of the Bible engage their
special attention and often win their hearts.
