Dishonored Chinese Students.

NEW YORK, August 23rd.â€” The Post of this evening says a number of
Chinese students now in the United States will soon be taken back to
China on account of offenses which they have committed. Among them is
T. C.  Chung, an excellent young man, who was graduated in the class
of 1879 at the Norwich (Conn.) Free Academy, and who is dishonored for
having cut off his cue. Woo, the new Commissioner at Hartford, is very
strict, and is conducting the Chinese schools under the rigid
discipline of the Empire.
