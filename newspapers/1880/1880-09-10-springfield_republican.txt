Yung Kwai, the Chinese student well known hereabout, who had been
ordered back to China because he had become a Christian, and recently
escaped from the agent who was taking him to San Francisco, has come
out of his concealment and gone on to Harvard college, which he had
fitted to enter. According to the treaty with China there is no power
to compel the young man to return home, and he will not be further
molested. The Chinese commissioner of education at Hartford says that
he never had anything against Yung Kwai, but was only induced to order
him home because of repeated commands from the boyâ€™s father.
