Kung Kai, a Chinese student aged twenty
years, attending school at Springfield, Mass.,
became a convert to Christianity. Sending
word to his father, a mandarin of the old
school, informing him of the change in his
religious views, master Kung received in
reply the order to "come home and be shortened."
But Kung had no relish for the idea
of being "shortened," or beheaded, as we
would express it, so he has concealed himself somewhere in the wilds
of Massachusetts, intending to remain perdu until
he attains his majority when he can become an
American citizen and bid defiance to mandarin authority.


The Christianized Chinese Student.

SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Sept. 11.---The Republican says Kung Kai, the
Chinese student who graduated at the High school last summer after a
residence in Springfield of seven years and who was since ordered home
because of his father's displeasure at his acceptance of the Christian
religion, has been informed that the Chinese government have abandoned
all efforts to carry out the decree concerning him. Kai started from
Hartford with a number of companions, who had been ordered home, for
San Francisco by way of this city. A few evenings since the case of
Kai was taken up by several friends and a lawyer employed, who
consulted Secretary Evarts. His reply, giving extracts from the treaty
between the United States and China, sets at rest all fears of the
friends of these young men concerning their liability to punishment on
account of their religion. The Chinese commissioner residing in
Hartford notified the young man and his friends that he would not be
molested.
