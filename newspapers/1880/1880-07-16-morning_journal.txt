Hopkins Grammar School.

The circulars of the Hopkins Grammar School for the year 1880-81 have
just been issued. In the honor list we notice are sons of
Dr. D. L. Daggett, Hon. G. H. Watrous, Prof. O. D. Allen,
Prof. W. P. Blake, Dr.  Timothy Bishop, Mr. J. C. Hollister, Mr. J.
S. Beach, Mr. W. S. Charnley, Prof. Thacher, Mr. H. T. Blake,
Prof. Verril, Dr. Nicoll, Judge Robinson and Dr. L. J. Sanford.  The
head boy of the school is Yan Phou Lee, a Chinese student, while the
honors in Latin composition and penmanship of the fourth class are
carried off by Chun Yot Chow. The course of instruction has been
slightly changed, a noticeable innovation being the study of
French. Of the 27 graduates of this school who applied for admission
to Yale at the recent examination, all were admitted, 16
unconditionally.
